You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and never one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that <unk> generally is something that fell somewhere left.
You just have to turn on the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the middle school, at the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed up every week in the bathroom of boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom room.
They did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I received a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults we never get to know us.
You could join Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to talk about this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the handle and the care of his family, because it was necessary, because it was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to become <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and put it on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> about snow after year.
<unk> are born when we come from the glaciers or the <unk> <unk>
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some refuse to refuse to hold up to the end, while others can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> passion for <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated by separated and by ourselves, largely as we see us as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> melts as a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As a eardrum a iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there exist in this way, and they'll never exist in there again.
It's not death when they're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way for life cycle.
Part of the ice from <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a bit frequent to actually actually see a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in size.
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single baby, OK.
So two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much into the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about understanding itself, they're not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the bacterial chromosome joins the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X bacterial chromosome joins the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get to talk about them later.
In my ocean activity to play two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way people put together the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluid, the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that works in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins -- two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with a lot more low than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical mix doesn't fit in the male and female groups and female women.
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopted many forms.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways that we have a sex that is not <unk> in the common or <unk> forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual <unk> <unk> which gene <unk> from the chromosome -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in <unk> life that will become <unk>
And then, in life -- the <unk> they produce testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks testosterone, body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops for a course typically female.
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes that something is happening.
After you test tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you might think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produced <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I -- I consider a <unk> woman, I don't know the <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me have the brain who has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> that has <unk> <unk>
That's why sex is complicated -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old kid born and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he'd just found out that he had <unk> and womb.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I had the wild chromosomes and the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that we basically created a hormone environment in a male.
As a consequence, their genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component of typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it went to the 19 years when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with wild chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> that they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to have any better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was going to be done to several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that one particular anatomy brings into a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- <unk> <unk> means to have African anatomy in recent terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when we give us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people within a same body.
The highest case is last year with the African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put in the <unk> of his sex on the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you do to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more you go through the science, more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were a stable <unk> categories that will be <unk> directly with categories <unk> -- they're much more <unk> than we <unk>
And it's not only in sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology of <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we go through science and more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we need to recognize that the categories of <unk> <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States of today, are the struggles at the beginning and in end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know in the <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you would put a pen in front of the nose and he moved still not to the <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract some vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, and <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
So let me argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It was <unk> from the concept point of a democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of physicians, <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so courageous and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
That's why it happened in <unk> with the fathers <unk>
The Parents <unk> was, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they were <unk> was a <unk> concept, and we did it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everyone remembers what our fathers <unk> our fathers -- <unk> was the idea of the <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old monarchs didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming in the right of blood passed from the grandfather of the father and then to the son, etc.
The fathers -- <unk> rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field of play and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not differences -- that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time will be <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the fathers -- <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of <unk> explanations <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> being transmitted by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of architecture talking about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement of <unk>
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We find men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who are <unk> to <unk> difference on the difference and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the Slow <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some divisions <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish that is the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should be able to do it before anatomy.
I don't mean that at the age of five years they were supposed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and whether they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two creatures at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, Mary. 3 months before time, June 1, 1980.
So Henry, in the contrary, was born in term: <unk> of 1980.
By the only fact that Mary is born three months before Mary are attributed to every three months before Henry -- the right to the heart of sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
So Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. For his part, it doesn't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much on the field of anatomy that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy might <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people left stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosome up and to marry a woman and have the Y.
Now, in practice they don't do test tests to people.
But this is also very strange that the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I mean <unk> offers a solution.
He says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems like that.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be thinking about this to help people, because I will admit that I know some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than people from 40 I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me wonder, what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to drive this current performance of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we'll make a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed -- unless you are willing to arrest a change of sex, in which case you can live alive.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple years ago that I had made to give birth to a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth to a few years ago that I had made to give birth to <unk>
But when the phone was asked for the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be those who are <unk> to change the same of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up I want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be like, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation in the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigate sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I thought I was interested in <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking wheat stereotypes -- so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I think the more I think about the question, more of the things have been a little female in <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male who makes us more attached to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the fathers were very attentive to figure out how to protect people from the state, is that we may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body -- in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect man, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007 year, I decided we needed to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks you want to go to live and work -- have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents in order to attract new residents to attract new residents in order to attract new residents in order to attract new residents in order to attract new residents in order to
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily go into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just laid out by building buildings.
Imagine that half of those who want to live in apartments already were owners and that the other half is still not even not worth it.
They could try to increase the capacity to make <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we're going to argue is that those buildings and areas around the world have rules to avoid the <unk> and the 6,000 years.
So it would be very hard to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a whole new place, build a apartment building completely new apartment building, and when the rules of that place would take the construction rather than putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments will bring new reform zones of mass enough to contain cities and gave them a name, <unk> cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next few elections, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> that was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a TEDGlobal. talk.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence in users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies like <unk> to <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about valuable people -- much more valuable than the <unk> cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, land that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those standards.
So the president of <unk> I called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that would measure by the least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The <unk> leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a city of a city that you might go might be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And they also have new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from countries -- they could benefit from the countries associated with the countries that they help them to establish and make the rules of <unk> so that they could all be able to trust the <unk> that they were actually <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is from there.
It could easily take about 1,000 square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk>
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, <unk>
<unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
The 17 of February was passed over again in another voting in <unk> to one.
Immediately after the released from 21 to 24, an delegation of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big city center that is building in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years was getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this shape, <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court of ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already figured out is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately another place.
There's a million per year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job -- sometimes they're mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do we build a dozen these, or a hundred these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about <unk> so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to bring new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what in the inside, I'm going to make a confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I became more recently, photograph and publishing on my blog <unk> colorful and different for each time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My look at it is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my size?
I'm like color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was looking for for this exciting great week at TED.
I mean, what about somebody who has all this <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear and nothing else.
<unk> in exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me like the woman who walks at TED <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I would like to show you now the data sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I think or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger it.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You can almost always see <unk> for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get away from the right people -- you don't just give you a little bit <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the kid who take on it.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look good at something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your interior and the outside, you don't look at it that you can't get <unk>
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week simply because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I left home, Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that's absolutely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them would take them through one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum quantum physicists are <unk> we need a lot of logic to address these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the age of years is that it says that one thing can be only at a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet play with that bar of parking lot taught him a precious lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have the world, except you are a particle physics.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play a car bars -- they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things really -- as they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years ago: you needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you don't need the needed to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit my way to my part of logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't have.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's actually right in the center.
And then here we do a very big approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard and a springboard for a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip of silicon and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole very <unk> <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people goes up, I stop doing those things, because I don't want them <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of the things of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights then put a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then we put it into a temperature of less than one degree above zero zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free of acting as you want.
So we measured their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it was like a breath in this form -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving a smooth thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't fit at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is <unk> and not at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same than the difference between metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places. Why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of <unk>
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turned it up, and we turned the lights into the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just putting into a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics says everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months old.
Many negotiations and stories, was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think that my own story is simply explaining to this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
better than I have a demo, and then I'll explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, let's go ahead and get <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, when I <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
Do you want to navigate through the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, jump inside.
They're inside that you want to go at the end of the hallway, right?
So go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, I think, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to want to do it.
So I began to play, and I found myself with something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the children were actually playing something to something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday page.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep in deep and you'll see that you can actually get the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh van actually created this <unk>
It increases it and actually <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get the cracks.
This is the <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen her before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have a lot of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can start online to create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just pull a fence around.
This is the <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital means to do justice to your artwork and it's represented in properly online.
And the big question that I'm doing today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian -- all the children in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened very interesting is something very interesting on performance races one in the last two decades.
So sometime ago, if you wanted to win a year race, one, I took a budget, and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you get a career.
This is what in engineering, it will be done in real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that real control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered and electronic networks.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a little note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet -- but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of <unk> consumption -- and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the late <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms go back and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like the old <unk> dream of <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it down to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> dent and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection again.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer, hopefully 2006.
It was the year in Italy that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, the end won in Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity on the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the afternoon, early there are people here and there are called <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a little bit of a call to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk>
There you see the great peak.
The next day, they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time, people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> it's not about people, but things that we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, -- how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its change by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if you look at every day that <unk> not disappears, which is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we cut off one day still goes on there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology be technology, the new technology will come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and <unk> valves tubes.
It's created as a water curtain, with pixels of water.
If the pixels can be written in them, showing patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can pass in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no windows, no windows, but when you get up to it opens up so you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the ceiling.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days will always be somebody in the winter, when the roof comes down the roof, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down almost the entire architecture goes away.
Here it works.
You see people <unk> so on the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes of water and one had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of using people to give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is an image of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections over them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, moving with others in synchrony.
Could we make this cloud, we could make this cloud,
It's kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then then all of that could a cloud of pixels in the one that you can reach, and you can see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements in 3D and use it as a entry for the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels to play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm as a <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could have all of them a little bit for a <unk>
And I think that the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign gave us the digital world of the digital power of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered in the pixel up.
You can move through the inside, you have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be more difficult, to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more health?
Or maybe these people who always want to be more creative.
What else would you do about it?
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you want the memory?
A few more.
And the state <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something about this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay titled <unk> it makes sense of the biology of <unk>
But if they effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
refers to the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is of course the most interested in you.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees, about six or eight million years.
In the interval, there's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry into the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> gave them the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm and light boxes, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you might want to want no effort to do.
It's really like a rapid disruption of the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk>
But then we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients -- they protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better <unk>
In this vast symphony of <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental to most of the existence of life, in organisms -- in the <unk> organisms, every cell you just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two unhealthy cells.
But when the organisms come out, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the death of death in the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every single year I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las <unk>
And one night someone hits her door to his hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a very small dancer of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, I say, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different aim for the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier ways.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and generation generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we will let us get to the sea.
I think I all <unk> the feeling as Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily happen to longevity.
They don't necessarily match the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the most intelligent one.
Evolution favors the best creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive to the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish that had fish there, but in the vacuum -- yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the <unk> phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and wiped out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, we're going to be <unk> and we were so excited that it's no longer possible to have the isolation isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that we have an evolution of the natural type, dictated by nature's forces.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of the <unk> when as a species, distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in the natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an possibility -- intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more male than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to be the individual and family level.
Think about that if they were possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs at a cost near the next 20,000 and a week.
It's not a lot of a lot of the human genome to actually make the human genome -- and will be increasingly <unk>
You get those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cell <unk>
Can you imagine something nice to go out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newly <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, remove the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases are going to allow us to allow ourselves to have a better memory.
Why don't we have an <unk> <unk> <unk> especially if you could be able to do it with the next generation of the machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to hand this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally I could take 100,000 years and we can call it to 1,000 years and maybe occur within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring, and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For a good thing or for worse, and before what I could do is these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day -- I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight flight.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot runs on the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three more <unk> words have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
Life was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before dying, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as the <unk> of George Washington -- that wasn't a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my own humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I would go into things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is kind of like your mental clock is going to be <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I went out, I had the feeling of, wow, die will not stop fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for this whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
One month later, I was on a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> as a small child.
And to me, that was the whole reason for me to be the world.
At that point I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And they gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live differently.
You're flying around today, the challenge that you can imagine that the same thing happens to you on your airplane -- and please don't be that -- but you can imagine, and how do you start?
What are you going to say they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> <unk>
One day he came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, <unk> has complete <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to lead to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody else and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate in that way, they get marking with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can I be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead he signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
And he told me with her brother and her father right there at that particular time, "All right, this is <unk> Tony is going to talk about -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn back again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inner can't get it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer draws on that and record space negative space.
So they're going around making art art like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on its <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, I joined the gates of the insurance companies, and we get a machine to be able to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know it. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world of <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were going down, they would have taken the frames off the walls and their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks old, we went to the <unk> factory, my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and so you can see the <unk>
These are a couple of <unk> <unk> glasses that we bought on <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things from Home <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it together on a light light, and now there's a device that's free -- and it builds up, we published the <unk> we published the <unk> <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There's no hospital that can say.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate with only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of programming all the night, Tony came back back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system, and it's looking through the support system of life.
We did the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he went back for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what we would say, "This was the first time that I was being in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to me and get me to get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device -- but it's the equivalent of a Touch <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to move it and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up at April of the <unk> is that in April of this year in <unk> <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible as possible.
Nothing that you have in this room was possible -- the computer stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something -- and I would engage with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel like we have to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked on a dangerous <unk> mine.
<unk> in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, most of my career I've been <unk> in situations in situations that are horrible in situations with the only purpose of trying to look at social questions in ways that are trying to analyze interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that is <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was coming here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been this: I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content would be <unk> especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company by doing it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to do it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you asked me a year ago, I would never have been able to get it for certainty.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've got myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could get me wrong, nothing could be <unk> for something that hard or as dangerous as I go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to treat the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom down, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that shows before the title of the title is the <unk>
Now this brand, we were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Only <unk> It was more <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the picture of the X <unk> in the title, but we're going to make sure that we would take all of the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you put a shoe and become the most cool shoe you've <unk>
The most great car you've <unk> in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you've been <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> making it <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is <unk>
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea -- all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk>  And <unk> David <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big places.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment the movie is going to look at us as a whole bunch of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be not.
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS:  means you're not very optimistic.
So, I get <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome. Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where it will go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it was, one by one, all of these companies were suddenly gone.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as much as possible, to get so many people to see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the stage of the apart, is not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a mistake, and that mistake was this one.
Actually, no, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem is what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first pictures that are introduced.
I like your <unk> Sergey Brin: No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in practical practices being the last line and the bigger problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> even CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to be <unk> <unk> story.
We want it to be a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was told me in a lie -- and there is him looking as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in a story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk> history.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John <unk> and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on to my own, I would have to take the <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to suddenly come up with, and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to business the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends who make large big, giant giant movies and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies say the reason why their movies are so successful is due to the associated markings that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can tell you to be good for this <unk>
You ready? You get a little bit nervous.
I want to help you make it <unk>
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there I offer you one of these <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> in bar, whatever.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk> look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
I get to the type of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind people is the reason why it interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe to <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you cool more time? I get better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define you your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I love <unk>
Volunteer: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> A little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like the dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and so on.
They usually take accessories.
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's partly <unk> partly <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of pet guy.
They put toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it was <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be made an Tom, but I often lie on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings to be.
MS: These shape people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me of that world.
MS: That world is, I think your world is the world in which you are looking at like people around you, your friends, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All of those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case start and start in my family, West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your form of being.
MS: It's like who I'd like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: <unk> Why do we do that?
What is the <unk> In which phase of <unk> you find you now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> you've <unk>
I don't have to be scared. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) Okay.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things in all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> brand -- Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were pretty well put together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think a few companies are only focused on one of their strong points or the other instead of focus on both.
Many companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give you something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are that?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see it also here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and geographical brands -- those things that have gone and come down, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> brand, which is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity <unk> your brand, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like playful to be cool like contemporary <unk> and bold or bold or bold -- like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more attribute <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional position, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable -- stable, familiar, reliable -- sacred, <unk> or wise people, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we get to tell the story in this movie of how now the MRI is now using the MRI centers to identify the brain centers in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where we are forbidden in the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are getting on the way in the schools with the available issues in America.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects that I have had the greatest answer or the ones that I've been more successful is the ones I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to treat directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it go? <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> Festival for a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million print in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to gain momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies we talked about would give their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that's pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train your employees on the loss of risk to risk is preparing their entire company to be <unk>
I feel that what happens to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, we are going to move forward, I think we have to give them the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to go to transparency.
More than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my entire <unk> <unk> <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies to companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED <unk> the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my country's spends next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we can engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective computer virus in a laptop used by an engineer to set up this gray, so we are ready.
This is the <unk> plan.
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box, hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discover this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes <unk> these systems of control.
And so that was struck by attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack?
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is effectively working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we say, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, for example, a <unk> power plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
better than we can get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and bring the attack, and we found out that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small small big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all internal information.
They would get all the points to attack.
And you probably even know how much the <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 <unk> lines of code.
It looks like old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at first were calls in the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to engage with the real world with potential for potential to the real world.
We need theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to the theories of goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran because the majority of infections has been <unk>
There are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant in <unk> and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our <unk>
I called them and I consulted an effort to get their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that piece of mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in a obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> shows up in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to research scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and a waterfall contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
So I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been all over a few weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to start back again.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would look at one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk>
There's the gray box and up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the value values of the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the sensors, and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack with fake data <unk>
And believe it or not, this data of false input is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the large steam turbine goes from speed, you have to open <unk> tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do this a human town.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And we don't have the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
There's nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a car factory.
It's <unk>
And you have no matter how to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be more possible.
And if you made that, with what we think about with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the greatest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large number of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and we need to deal with this now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There is one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because otherwise our problems would be older than that.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to be able to take and give you some <unk> skills or another one that makes users in your wheelchair get up and get back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, it gives you a great force, who also increases its speed, and helps you help drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who on average, you have to take on their back, a <unk> load of pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some major complications in the back of 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic harm damage.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Rights
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can take it to you 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design is allowed to put into <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back in the back of the wheels of wheels on what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in roughly, in the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- at the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide with a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only choice.
We also talk about the population that goes up very quickly.
Its only option, many times -- for brain injury, or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
You have some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> on the crutches that send signals to the computer on board on the back.
There are some batteries that give the power on the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it forward to this <unk> smooth <unk>
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing up costs <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the motion of <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope for me to be.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down the bottom -- climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have the whole potential here to change the future of future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of the wheels of the wheels of the everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet his cousins.
This is the world of <unk> the wild <unk> of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives, closest ones.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where death violence hasn't yet been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to be <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> trade and deforestation are making you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear that hidden laughter -- the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflicts and solving social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them to play the game is critical to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn with <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, of interactions, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the word Bonobo <unk> you see the roots out of the laughter, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild videos.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I don't talk about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much in bonobos as humans.
And this video is really interesting because we put this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing things into unusual elements of play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of shapes, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where makes me <unk>
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like that, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we formed are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But <unk> the most of our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For Bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least right in play, it can be the most <unk>
So fellow primates, for us to accept this gift of evolution and play together as they bring creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a department of firemen in a Australian computer.
And in our city, where volunteers exist to a highly skilled staff one has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race to standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
And we were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer who had just gotten before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> came up to the captain and he was asked to go and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a live living because I won my five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need you to get in the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen -- that at that height or less had ended the fire and walked into the fourth room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load out of the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house house for the house owner where, as you would expect, their trove was a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the home owner of the <unk> <unk> for the brave <unk> effort to save her home.
The kindness that she was looking for about what else was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as on my calling as a firefighter volunteer to volunteer acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are for <unk> remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait for the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get now.
They were running food in a dining room, they would have a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you go into the <unk> <unk> shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of cement modules that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 blocks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or <unk>
<unk> made it accessible.
He just took the block of concrete, the favorite block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to take the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that led us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on a few other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block of concrete, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, one brick at the time.
But there's a difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't get it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green one, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just assemble one blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make older circuits in it.
A blue one with one green makes light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button through a pulse module that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program it, connect and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or slower or slower or slower and just turn this button that makes the pulse is faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection of growing.
We want all the interactions in the world to fly into bricks and ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> everything has to be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronic designers start to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the <unk> School designers.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> truck per movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can see the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is seeking to get involved in the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue better leave the video next to one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I know the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we're supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
I got a few members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them into the Third World we send them into wild world.
They did large <unk> they worked with employees who are <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a hydrant in Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a date, but what it really looks for is that somebody has to clean up when it was caught by snow because he knows that it's not very good when it's covered by a foot of snow.
How did it get to ask for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment I spent a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens would be <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
So when you do that, you put a name, in this case he got him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 killer app last year.
But does something like any other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible station in the city of <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it, not to the snow, but for the citizens to be <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to get people to get rid of sidewalks when they were going.
So now we know about nine cities that we have <unk> using it.
And this has spread without <unk> in organic and natural.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen.
<unk> acquisition of software takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then we told us that it was done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and over two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the <unk> of California that the time has been over 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows you in a couple of days and it spreads in viral form is a kind of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the government better ways to work, not as a lot of people who think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in the open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good at collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to connect them together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to applications of <unk> every day in their own communities.
They have not given the government.
They have a great frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they're alone not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government is ultimately produced by us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way it thought about it will affect the way change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of health care and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you become <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the door door to the house, put it very hard and see if it was <unk>
And so it worked.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a web and a mobile app called <unk> <unk>
They didn't give that application.
It was the work of very clever people in the Office of New York <unk> <unk> of Boston.
One day, this happened really, is this <unk> <unk> in my junk. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do <unk>
The <unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went home. I went home.
Good evening, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical physicist.
And it's also a great example of the government income to mobile volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And I could have been connected to the government services that we need to do, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, they will bring the communities.
If we call animals control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the input of the other.
That our input system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> We sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and our values and then we don't see changes.
That's because government is like an immense ocean and politics is a shallow surface layer.
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which keeps us from that that we have actually funded as something that is operating on our against the other thing, and because we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy feel sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They've got them <unk>
It's a bunch of citizens worried that they've written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> over the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for those of us that have been <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask ourselves how we want to leave our children.
We have to see huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't solve government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government as it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, I am an older generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who are going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem you don't care much to get hearing your voices.
They're using their hands.
They set hands into the work to program applications that make a better function of the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a garbage garbage inside the <unk>
Of course, we were able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have <unk>
So I want to ask all of the present, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the death of the prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that are focused on projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus -- has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is impact on the whole world.
On occasion, if something come from TED, it makes a sense and a force that wouldn't have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we saw fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning in it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was difficult, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery on the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery and the way it looked like the world.
She was <unk> but she was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at him, she was approaching me a good hug.
I was so heavy that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> I was approaching me, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was telling me again and if I said yes, I was in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it was not easy to capture their time and their attention.
My cousins were running all over the place.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up in the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and she said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. The two will be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell it to <unk>
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, I just want you to get three things -- <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want to want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I think about it.
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> That's how <unk>
And then finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother and older brother and sister a little year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where <unk> grabbed my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just get to do the <unk> of all the time.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no, no. All right, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today <unk> <unk> And you always do the same as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I hit my eyes with a force and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will spread <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that you don't think to be able to do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to which, according to it, we had to have a <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my view, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor and black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or for parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore and Washington -- 50 to 60 to 60 percent of all young people in jail or for parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of the race, it's about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some developments some great developments quite curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well in other states, if you have a rights <unk> if you have an criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to a vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where he was sentence at age 13 to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without a chance to go back.
Now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in death row.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a certain sense we have told us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
Out of nine people <unk> has identified one that is innocent and released from death death row.
An innocent rate was an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never allow you to fly airplanes if every nine to <unk> you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of that if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I talk about slavery to you.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to the Second World War.
Actually, we don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined times by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what its lives.
Now there are more people who come up to me and say, <unk> Stevenson, you teaches talks, <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our own history, for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we went through each other.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's pretty disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> is not death penalty in Germany.
We would never be able to be here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "No way to our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we were to <unk>
So let's focus on this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
Recently we talk about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> those who never get to TED.
And if you think about them -- in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
The development of innovation, with creativity.
These things come from ideas -- also by the <unk> of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, guidance for spirit, a willingness to be in places that are <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect with technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together simply to speak.
Occasionally, the lady was called me to go, <unk> comes to me comes Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and get them out.
I said, "Be lady. I know I do."
And so she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me tell you this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I began to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom to say to children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end up with <unk> <unk>
I gave him all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "Well, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> exhausted, very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got <unk> and he said, "That's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, that problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is higher at the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something they don't <unk> it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge us by our technology, for our designs, or our own intellectual and rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful rich, but as they treat the poor, <unk> prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
I sometimes do too much force.
<unk> wonder like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years -- that have been <unk> so that they were taught as adults to do.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn somebody in what it isn't it?
The judge took it as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was awake -- my God, if the judge can become something that you're not, you must have magical powers.
Yeah, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer -- a little poor, white.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> saying, <unk> for my 14-year-old black client in 14 years to be treated like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I put there had been <unk> behavior in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> she had sent it to court.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to cut this case stupid.
I got up to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car -- I walked around to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you. I said yes.
So I approached myself and I get stuck.
And I told you about the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That connected into my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> And we started walking.
People started to come, they were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops the prosecutors and the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. All right, because we were talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I was able to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I looked at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
I would walk over here and there.
Finally, this old black guy, with a concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break, a <unk> I showed you, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant over the old black black.
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood stood up, he looked at me and she looked at me and said, <unk> this young man in the audience to tell this young man who will keep her view on the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds up to justice.
That we can't really be truly human humans, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view of the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your case, do something.
Something that is not a check.
<unk> There are several opportunities.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to make an effort to take care of the funds that are spent today in policy today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases were not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that this funds are going to be <unk> to get the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There have been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the reason, it's said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is?
<unk> Actually, <unk> rate has remained relatively stable.
The large growth on massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war.
That's why this is dramatic increase in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> by robbing a bicycle crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got to be excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six days of years.
The idea is that the media would prefer <unk> negative news, because our minds would pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second, our senses are getting lots of more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And because nothing matters more than survive, the first stop standing from all of this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> stories of stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there's blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us news news seven days, 24 hours a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going on a lot of worse.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, instead of what's really happening is that we get <unk>
Maybe progress has been done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the <unk> of the species, the scarcity of water and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings are really good at <unk> the problems and, in the long run, we ended up with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average per capita income has been involved by inflation all over the world.
Child mortality has dropped down 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy was 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, they would take the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under poverty have electricity, toilets, <unk> TV, <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
So let's get a lot of this stuff out of this technology, and then it has exponential growth.
My good friend of mine, Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool we could think about on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good time, and in the war in peace, in the war in peace, in recession, in the <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop against any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, my friends in <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and provide personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuel fuels and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" of Watson, of Watson, at <unk>
It was <unk>
I tried to <unk> the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this:
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
It plays up with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that it's <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the <unk> king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon had covered with silver, and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, it was worth gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington Washington is from aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure metal as well.
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum thing so cheap we use it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy towards the future.
So let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 percent of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents a <unk> by hour compared to 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager Voyager spacecraft, in 1990, after I passed a <unk>
<unk> a famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A <unk> point.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yeah, <unk> water is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 to 20 years, but right now.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I would like to share with you, he gave me permission to get your technology called <unk> <unk> The <unk> is the size of a small walk.
It's able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> water, saltwater water, a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola has just thought about hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence in which I will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation by this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better mobile communications in Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to have a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video of <unk> images, libraries of books and music technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best I get to get to the health <unk>
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is the X <unk> <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We're challenging the world teams so that we can put these technologies into a mobile device that they speak, and because they have <unk> they can get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a <unk> or DNA or DNA that we won't call the health of the health and, first of all, to stop the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the mark of the 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online and connected.
By 2020, we will go from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add into global conversation.
What are these people?
What <unk> <unk> <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the highest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health from the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about the voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and they can act for the first time?
What are these 3,000 <unk>
And if they're contributions that we can't afford it.
Something that I learned with the X X is that equipment for his passion with an objective of course, they can do things -- things that they could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end a story by sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played this with <unk> college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together, and they started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds -- new minds that we have to be surprised to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You probably believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 percent, black <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the number of fish had dropped in half.
It took five inches.
It will be a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was to impose the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad and <unk>
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in southern China and <unk> and above all, in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture there, we captured a little bit <unk>
I know now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are fish from coral reefs.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then you start the commercial fishing.
The bottom is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to take it off, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what you collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they never have fish.
But it's no <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
We got the starting point to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, we have a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images that are going to be the beginning of their conscious life like normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the safety of changes.
And at the end of the <unk> <unk>
And that, in large extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies, kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before we <unk> it is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they would expect that to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like captain such as a captain just looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the <unk> scientists because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the past.
And there is a huge role that can make a protected marine zone.
Because with the protected protected areas, we actually recreating the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run up and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that we <unk> which allows you to erase their <unk>
And what about people who can't do that because they don't have access, as people in the Middle East, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may be able to fill in the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Bay <unk>
And you might have noticed the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were touched with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> Why do you go to <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
That's why my <unk> the only one to give, is to determine <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube video.
It's true.
So we're going to see today why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But now the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a little percentage of those, it's also receiving infinite and <unk> and cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> of trends, and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed video outside in the National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of the last summer.
<unk> I was not proposed to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this story that would bring into the video to popularity
The creators like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, you've got to start on a Friday.   You all want to get the end of a week, the weekend.    <unk> Friday, <unk> on Friday.  KA: Let's think you could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> -- we would have this video like it seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, on Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But what's important is that one person or a group of trends will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a longer public audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shares this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> on YouTube.
In the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation called a <unk> music.
That's it, that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird -- you know that there is a <unk> version of three million times.
And so far, you saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity behind the Internet community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then international became done.
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen of being a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> Are we <unk> or Rebecca or Mrs. <unk>
What script might have been written to <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video goes up for minute, just the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of protest against <unk> in New York City, I admit I didn't think too much.
Casey <unk> I mean, they don't circulate for the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you running through the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise and his humor, Casey Casey <unk> that five million people saw and understand his idea.
That's why this approach is worth for all the new things we do in <unk>
And all this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new type of media, from a new culture, which we all have access to and is the audience that defines the popularity of <unk>
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics -- it's just the ones of the current means but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, an <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been fully in vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now I have it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget her story.
My task was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when her father died, and two little girls were <unk>
For her, life was destined for a <unk> task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat slid into the sea dressed in <unk>
All of the adults knew the risks.
The major fear was the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
If we were to first take my sister first, we would take my sister and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were fooled with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start by six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the oil platform in front of Malaysia, Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, it was too much to get it, and the first apple I tried, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> class <unk> whose population is made of immigrants from lap.
Unlike the middle class in the middle class whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English was <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found time to study English and get a master's title of the <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and math, wouldn't mind what was <unk> which was generally <unk> it was always <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide holes in the other.
A school uniform to <unk> because it had to last six years.
And I had <unk> and <unk> about <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
He was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I would walk into the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would tell us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares are going to start to be able to make it <unk>
She opened a computer store, then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> boys and young kids caught between two worlds.
They took subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, I was the classic classical student of the relentless <unk> of myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically, <unk> by violence, abuse and insulation.
But many people got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer, I was choosing the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't know.
As a resident resident from <unk> was now called <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk to sites that I had never heard of, <unk> and houses whose existence she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the routines. and the happy life of life in a suburb -- a mother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I was now the same age that she had when we got into the boat.
The "no" had ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were going to do, living on the boundary of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown new one, new in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that they hadn't been <unk> were <unk>
There was an energy there -- an <unk> optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
He brought a small group of people to say to the <unk> to <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant soup pot that all <unk>
It's going to be the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up.
I made a decision to move to the U.S.
And after one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before you finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he made a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her own, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
It cannot be done to be <unk>
I was in the shower in a <unk> hotel when she died, she died, in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell them stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came up and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They haven't got it.
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would be easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that for you?
But I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing to do.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, <unk> brave in each wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them safe would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians want to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplane now.
At that time, when I was <unk> the great Indian warrior -- I was <unk> I took a bow and with a <unk> to the ground, he could see water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we launched was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was telling me this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent the cameras out of it.
We love our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> I was dropped to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
And you get the text out with the image, it animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But why do we do that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  -- he says, "This box belongs to me. I write my name.
And so I get a character of the book.
And at several moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but at that magic magic of childhood, those ideas that we were talking about children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned to me exciting.
So over here, we need to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And, really, they light your way into the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole galaxy was <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is to create Indian content and see contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people were out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's history.
In a story that deals with current issues like environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they have not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out to the outside, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this ritual from childhood -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, <unk> a picture and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is created a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "We saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
And within variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we asked to have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and using augmented reality -- you see an animated group that appear on the inner plants of the house.
And at a moment the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature are coupled with technology and magic and technology will come to each other.
We reduce the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and love love that we sat through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What do you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that all of us, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail, because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> and closed switch.
Every morning I get stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got a challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it is so simple, that every time I come up with my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time that it needs assistance or some urgency of that style -- but it can see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before I get to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be able to move people into their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week to be available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people are going to take them from their homes, take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to <unk> and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of health care and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have navigation controls in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, they already open up in a long office time and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks using their cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to do it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so we will help us find and work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, can find it.
Also I'd like to invite companies around the world that could help us make these <unk>
They might be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that you can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was awakened to my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because of using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that process ends up when you presses the <unk>
For me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place at the right time.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by hitting the <unk>
It was like this: a building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has an unexpected turn.
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures as dark <unk> and colorful in the time, but with the common aim of <unk>
And when I say, realism <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to look like it seems to be captured in some way like photography.
I think you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to see with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them really real?
Are the details or the <unk>
Did you get light?
What creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But at the end it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic as realistic as we think it's realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects -- something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem to be realistic and I think they're those in which we don't even define the things around us in our everyday life.
But when they combine pictures it's very important, because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I'd like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures -- <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are associated with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a perfect partner.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the personal thing, I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas that have in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured by a rock.
And yes, I even did red the house of the top of the island so that it looks more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic result of an realistic result I think you need planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and rather a <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on a very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general aspect of it.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other people that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on the <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk>
I'm talking about technology with <unk> curves -- is new.
So here is something strange.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn up the lights.
It would be more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we <unk> <unk> technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time -- and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to put on the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like that.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transport, on a curved curve -- it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it becomes a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport technology is just as fast as we could have happened tomorrow tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years will be orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves that are not following forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We have one of two things.
Or it's going to be a typical curve -- I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I ask myself, is: what is that new way you adopt the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing, if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And that happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it might be that <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand that is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I'd like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about a couple of two billion years when the Earth was a huge sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are coming around it.
So if we look at the way those chemicals organize us, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that's that, at that point, there were some oil oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those drops of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that gave them to incorporate materials from the outside and the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- these oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each of them had a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they were <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow become better at the time of bringing chemical chemicals together, <unk> more chemicals and get more <unk>
They were usually more <unk>
It was a form of life, very simple, very simple, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of the abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what it was to be able to be able to do it.
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I made only for <unk> We can now write things with this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> white powder that I try to hide to the airport.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing the DNA was an interesting step.
It made these cells very happy another billion years old.
But then another big step on the one that things got very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information to form that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, were together in a way, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community they were <unk> more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came up so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe in the medical community in a string chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities that are <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without heart cell or the brain cell or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they weren't doing more than process in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities built built.
In fact, they started <unk> within community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the amount of evolutionary time.
So an organism, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit of fruit.
And so the fact that the nervous system built these information structures that had tremendous accelerated information that is an evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen now confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication trick.
So, for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of a <unk> idea.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that kept some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to function as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to perform <unk>
We now spend through similar periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and talk information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape, <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much bigger and more quickly and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated over time scales again.
The first stages of the story that I told you about took a billion years each.
The next few stages. The nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
Over the other, the language, and so they took less than a million years.
And returns, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that causes its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get to make life designing computers, and I know the mechanisms that employment for <unk> would be no possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that something that does something that you couldn't before -- it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the more extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run 100 million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those things that are more than we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say that I want to kind of like to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order right in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
And they would take those and <unk> the rest.
And now we're going to tell the ones that are better than the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that children would take the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs product from the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
It will come back again.
They gave some mutations in it.
And it tries to try and get it back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in some complicated, very few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that you will use numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to test them to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know it, I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they succeeded.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
I once went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he says, "Look at this.
He says, "You have hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> <unk> doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices there that are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to do a lot faster and so can be able to run these programs much faster.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog moment when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to our thinking that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes from.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I get <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to give myself a part of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> <unk> talk about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope a lot of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that we had 300.
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to throw the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to do it at the first base, not to get time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk>
Well, really, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is someone that <unk>
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last baseball player in <unk> in running more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world in medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you go into a surgeon who has also a record for 400 in <unk>
That's how it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a remote place and a dear <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family physician goes to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But know what?
She's getting too much better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask you.
What do you think about to be the average of the hits of a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
Very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or <unk>
What we do, though, is to send me the world, and I include the <unk> to be perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a Turkish student.
Once, a fellow in high school, said that Brian Goldman thousand people were studying a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the nurses of nurses at General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> sexual diagnosis frequent and <unk>
And I even knew the political diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as far more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if I did everything, then it would know everything, or the most possible thing at all, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency service where I worked on the emergency room.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room I requested you to go to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
and reporting to the Chief <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, what I leave with heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are filled with blood, and so there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was going to do.
I gave it <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> so it could be able to eliminate liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the <unk>
I didn't get up the phone and did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to bring up <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to pay constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even in contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
He sent it to his house, he didn't pay attention to a voice on my inside that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, he was so insecure that I asked the nurse to join Mrs. <unk> "Do you think it's good if she goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think I'll be good."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that the ambulance together and the ambulance together with the <unk> took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in your stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went back to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't usually do normally, at the time.
I went through the emergency room service in the house.
And there is another nurse, not the one who was going on from the lunch lady before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most emergency emergency doctors were born.
Other people fear fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: what does you?
"Do the patient remember the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And then she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
On an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the high time, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> and they brought her to the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock to <unk>
I was barely breathing and was blue.
The emergency staff would take all their resources.
They gave her medication to raise blood pressure.
They put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because then that <unk> was in intensive care and hoped that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let him go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks, I would take care of it and experienced for the first time, shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone, <unk> that shame is because you can't touch your colleagues.
You make the peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The embarrassment of which I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was we were wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I just followed those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose to <unk>
Shortly that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, <unk> opened the sky and finally came out the sun and wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I were to make the efforts to be perfect for not making more errors, would you do all of those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back.
Two years later, it was teach in the emergency department of a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent out penicillin and sent him home.
But while he was running the door, still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to my guard, my chief asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw in the <unk>
Well, he came back and had no <unk> <unk>
He had potentially fatal condition. It had <unk>
You can search at Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's the top, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
You were <unk> antibiotics and <unk> and recovered at the few days.
And he went through the same kind of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, and went back to work, until over and over again, and again.
Two times at the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it's going to be 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray shot -- but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
It made the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who would take it.
I looked at it, and when I noticed a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated on, and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't get to you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach you this to make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this one, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after a failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time looking at it.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and those who can't sleep, and the ones that I know; they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you go from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical health and medical errors to learn as possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto "Star <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes are happening every day, where one of 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where bacterial infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 10,000 Canadian medical errors are <unk>
The United States Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there's things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is doubling every two or three years old, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in your chest, it comes with <unk> eyes and I breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't have their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we were <unk> and we eliminate all the blind professionals to error, well, it will not be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white, <unk> art, it's a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> -- this is my worst <unk> blah blah -- "What are your <unk>
And their students get rid of their head down to the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> be able to say, "Look, don't they make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, you know human, they accept it, and they don't talk about their mistakes, but it tries to try to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and they support them to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
I feel a lot about it, but I strive to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what they think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says, pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot, on a research followed for a group of scientists.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and time that we were going to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
You know how many they belong to the <unk> category of how many of an hour?
How did they follow the way that it deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose in the options.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know about your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when I ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> problem.
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, I took this very <unk> level at least at least at least at the time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but I was one occasion, why I never bought anything?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had over 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Do you get this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
We put a place for <unk> right at the shop.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First, where case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent, that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here's the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when he had gone off, only three percent came to buy <unk>
The ones that stood up when there was six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a lot of good enough to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem that makes choices affect us in very well <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, from about 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings plans available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that it really had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge fund were less participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation is 70 or more, not as high as I wanted to.
And in the plans that I would offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation landed in the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, even in that case, there's unintended consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people would be inspired by avoiding the actions or hedge funds.
As much more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future of financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by giving them more and more possibilities.
They are more likely to make the decision, that <unk> even when it goes against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they see them better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, contrast and choose from that awesome <unk>
Today I want to tell you about four simple techniques that we've gone through in one way or another, in different research so that they can test in their businesses.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more than today, which is more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, you get rid of <unk> choices -- there will be a <unk> increase in sales -- there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> <unk> we removed from the products for food -- that less <unk> became increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> more sales and under cost costs.
And you know that today's shelves in the average offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store. it's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a type of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world savings world, I think one of the best examples that have arisen on how to handle the choices is David <unk> and the Harvard program.
All Harvard employees are <unk> automatically at a certain amount of life.
Those who really want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford them, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be ready to offer people in this audience a couple of vacation with all paid the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take a round of applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I actually got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images would make it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very concrete, very concrete, too.
Why do people spend 15 percent of 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being transferred to a <unk> plan.
So that meeting is exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that they would tell the staff to think about the positive things that they would make in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number that were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine hallway,
What we saw was that in the retail <unk> along the <unk> display of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the on the right is <unk> but you know what?
This framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that they were <unk> not to the one that <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk>
Who are supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a good decision to buy a car.
This is a German car manufacturer that allows for <unk>
You have to make 60 decisions, to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that are offering each one.
<unk> the outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order of making the decisions.
So half of customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go in a few options, four <unk> in 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you do that.
If you were always <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the defect button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Now if you pick the box of changes that doesn't say anything about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that are now more coupled with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> we want to get rid of alternative alternatives -- we can make it <unk> <unk> we can drive more categories with less than <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've introduced them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, to use them in their business, or for the people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about the <unk>
And the more careful we will be in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years, in the East Germany in East Germany, if you had a typewriter <unk> to the government.
You had to register a piece of text in written with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of texts.
If they found a writing with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that somebody could do this, how much we would bring freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color of any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a little dots on print that are still a pattern that makes them one pattern that makes it one and a printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, huge amounts.
There are actually a lot of online materials, online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or <unk> our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going on the worse.
In the future, most crimes in the line.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we observe today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, their opinions, they motivate them laughter.
These groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national the governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> or actually it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
I got the safety of the site and there's a <unk>
I was asked, in a meeting with representative government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority authority.
<unk> <unk>
So why do we do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they would have a foreign authority authority for the foreign authority.
And the leading <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the Gezi protesters -- the <unk> <unk> headquarters in April, 2011, and during the building of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government and the Egyptian government to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
Either Western governments give them tools to governments that have to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, the <unk> <unk> was used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
The connection to the Internet.
We have even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be said, "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me, because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I don't have anything to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy for security.
It's about freedom against control.
Now, if we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to have today, will be forever.
We blindly blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South National Park.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park of Nairobi.
The Yellowstone National Park, it doesn't have fences in most part of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, how the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead in the morning and we found it very bad because it was the only bull we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and therefore we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of lions.
People were dying are warriors that protect our community and won, and they are also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think it's so few in the National Park of Nairobi.
A kid in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared to them.
But I realized that actually, this was not <unk> because even helping lions see the pen from a distance.
I don't <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  they came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they went out, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So it jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, male lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch on and turn the lights.
And this is a little light bulb <unk>
They get everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> electricity to the little box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> go outside, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see lions when they come at night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so you think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never got the problems with lions.
And the homes of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators as a hyenas, <unk> and it's also used to be able to be used to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go from
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have it, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a boy in the Talking of the savanna the cows of my father, and he used to see airplanes and said that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come on plane for the first time to TED.
My big dream is to get to be an engineer at aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a close electrical CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know they invented electric vehicles, but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would give it a time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: The foot of the cannon. Richard <unk> are a big thing.
We're going to take it on every single step of my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little bit, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, which is the enemies.
Though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed in a flash.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and myself never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a colleague of my sister.
That said, "When <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks ago.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
When I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child who was in his arms looking at his arms looking at his mother's face.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine will come to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few of them survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also made more and more common energy cuts all around me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite piece of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out from North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was sitting in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart went to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another one, "This was a fake report that's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there were eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to find a lot of other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everyone can be <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I decided to hazard an <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much higher challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through a crisis of identity.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was a country that could call with pride of mine.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I had a plan. I started studying for the income test.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money sent to my family, and as my family punishment was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to run immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it in some way, for more than 3,000 miles through China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all and started asking questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought that my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were people who were <unk> who was <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the <unk> guards at <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did all for free for my family, and we were so close to my family, and we were so close to my family in a short <unk> from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and he came in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that point, or the voice of a man says, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and with a dictionary, I explained to him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North prison.
I took him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown thing is a new hope for me and for the village to get them more <unk>
And it showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the people <unk> needs.
With time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieve their freedom is only half of the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English practice of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help us giving North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center for <unk> shops -- fast food, rough terrain.
So the city planners came together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this is really wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, land.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a food desert. The Los Angeles Center for food places to drive and eat in the car.
What's funny is that the places of food to get killed more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in L.A., South Pole.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, Beverly <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home you see the effects of <unk> that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs with <unk> and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet old.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it going.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to get it out.
That's how I decided to keep it going.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put ourselves together and we started planting our food forest and trees -- you know, nine fresh vegetables ...
What we do is, we are a kind of <unk> group made out of all the <unk> all over the entire city and completely voluntary -- and everything we do is free.
And the garden was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city looked at me and <unk> they gave me a little bit of saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on in right?
An order court for plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Okay, I was going.
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
L.A. had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called it to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the American city with more terrain.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of <unk> plants.
Why on Earth does it look like this.
<unk> a plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
You get your own food in your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Just as a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I would <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if you let the canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool, of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
They are trying to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and provocative act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, which came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> on the night and they were in my yard, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when you see people that I was so close to hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I mean, "Oh my God no, I am not afraid you're going to get it to <unk>
That's the road.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at their time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a refuge in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this had affected me, and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer plan.
If the kids grow up, kids eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat them <unk>  But if none of this are being taught if they are not taught how food is affecting your mind and your body, eat blind people in front of it.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see some color guys who are on this way that are designed for them, which doesn't take them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may have the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, take the kids from the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I'm not called you if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and get meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very beautiful road at all.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on it on your bicycle and these cars go down, that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, you want a quiet road, like that.
The solution for that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, have pores and water can pass through it, so all the water flowing flow down the sides and you will have a road that is so easy to drive, and you don't have any water anymore.
The noise also disappear into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that in this road the stones on the surface of the surface go out.
First stone -- then several more and more and more and so forth and so forth, and they will not do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more harm.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, can be converted into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if you <unk> it will be <unk> and they will be separated from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool out into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits of pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you can use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are sticking back to the surface.
Today a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here on the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, that now I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried lots of samples out there and then the government, they actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to be <unk>
So we gave us a little bit of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a lane of trial to test this material.
So that's what we did there. See where we were doing the test test, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of payload on them, the ones and then with our <unk> machine, and we came back to a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using fibers of steel, incorporating these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, even you can double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this worked.
We still have it here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before I can show you what it behaves like.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC BBC on his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in her face that was unusual at those time, because the news generally does it.
<unk> <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they made that illegal girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my eldest sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were both able to get the two to <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that no one could be suspect of where it will be.
We had to hide the books in market <unk> so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that our lives <unk> our lives, the students and our parents.
Every time in the school suddenly was suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We were always wondering what they know of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first one of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that her children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not raising her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were times when I was very frustrated in our life, and she was always scared and not to see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you help you leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here -- and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education to pay your education, we will.
So, you still don't want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the age of school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate her daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not only <unk> from my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I have been driving it on the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm a global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's so <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families that, as the mine, <unk> by them, despite them, even though in front of a opposition we know.
As <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice had noticed that if he was following her daughter to school, they would come back to me.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but they won't harm the future of my daughter for your old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and this is something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there's a parent who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, often they are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were at school got to school, remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in America.
I find Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And so that these changes didn't last long after the retirement of American troops on the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who are <unk> by them, that <unk> see a future <unk> and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of the <unk> I read it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk>
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the revolution broke out, inspired by mass of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the regime, leading freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have a speech copy the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> the East, up to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal war and a few losses of about 50 percent dead, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have dear, along with a lot of other women, rebuild civil society <unk> a <unk> transition to democracy and the national <unk>
About 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing skills and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the Women's Women of Women -- a women's movement leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right of our <unk> participation in the construction of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was shipped and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections for 52 years.
But shortly by little, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news about violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> ancient <unk> and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of murder of the American ambassador and the heart attack.
Another day we woke up with the news of murder officers from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and his mere copyright violations.
Our society, made out of a molecular mindset, it becomes more <unk> and it's far away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, dignity, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today at all to engage with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we made the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections not brought peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like <unk>
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the election that you need the election, which is just the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs <unk> representation of feminine more than <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as <unk> and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also put it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> <unk> collaboration in the competition, inclusion rather than <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> for war, desperately desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in the existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> female and <unk> that spans all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples that all tribes and all the peoples are <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- the entire existence.
So this is how we tell us, "My mercy for all the things."
This is how we tell us, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a controversial question that has a equally <unk>
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is what I'm going to deal with is that they all make the same. Why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no master in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that count.
I was 22 years old. He had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first <unk> my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk>
The man, the one who loved more than anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where each year millions of women, and even some men.
So it could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies in the list of <unk> <unk> between Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
It's almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> <unk> and long duration or <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we want or we would be able to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who sticks, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women at age ages 16 and 24 years old, have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I also went a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signals or its patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and Native night of January.
He was sitting next to me in the subway of New York City, and he started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was just <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples and a <unk> <unk> wheat, and he seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it especially at the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started out and loved everything of <unk> that I had gone to Harvard, I had gone to Harvard, that I would put a passion to help girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done before.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go out of New York and quit the work of my dreams, but I thought I'd got to do sacrifices so I had to go, I quit my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head of a public trap financially and psychological psychological ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it <unk> it.
And this is where you go into the scene those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you are supposed to be so safe that I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another he kept it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived of small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I never had my hand, my hand, my life was already serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend brought out of my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was simply a very <unk> sense of a wedding and a family to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never make me harm.
I spent twice as well as our <unk>
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and she <unk> me and he gave me so hard in my head that I would spend various times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back our moon of our moon, went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to my face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half of our marriage.
I told myself when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or bullying.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is, why don't you just <unk>
Why don't you <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we have our victims, we know something that normally you -- it's incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence cases happen after the victim has made the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> from financial resources and manipulation of the family court system to help the victim and their children, who are typically compelled to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man loved so much, would have killed me if he would have allowed.
So I broke silent.
I told everyone the world -- to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family members, and I'm here today because all of you will love me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims like <unk> <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people that is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also assumed that they learned an authentic lesson from what happened to them and that they embrace their lives and joyful lives and happy lives of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I became married with a cute little guy, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have never more, would ever be a <unk> gun to my head in someone who says he wants me.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk to what you've heard here.
abuse is only based on silence.
They have the power to end up with domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need the whole world.
We need each of you understanding the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the light into light talking about it with their kids, their coworkers and family.
They take their view of survivors as fantastic and <unk> people who have a future <unk>
You know, the early warning signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims of a safe way.
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> who should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward strain in the room because I should not have got myself dressed like this.  luckily, I brought it clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of luck <unk> I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what they think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less than I don't have to use.
The worst part is going to get this sweater through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he <unk> the back of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or a <unk> <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little to be able to do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how are it going to be model?
I always say, a <unk> discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what is this inheritance.
Well, over the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have associated with <unk> and <unk> shape and <unk>
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now showing you, and maybe there are some <unk> who are <unk> Hold on. There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always do is, can it be a model when you can <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If you have this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> head of <unk> American <unk> or the next Steven <unk> or next Steven <unk>
To say that more you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get down your studies, and you have a copy of a copy and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you want, you know, if you want to be president of the United States, but your copy you want to be president of the United States, but your record will be <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a girl.
So I looked along with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group -- <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always doing is, <unk> for free?
I have too many heels. Six inches -- and that never use, except the <unk> but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk to.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> a red <unk> and of course, <unk> and <unk> by sorry, agent so that I could continue to <unk>
<unk> of these privilege by my respect, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their matter whether no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and the last year of the <unk> teenagers who were couple and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, not a question of <unk>
But how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I research this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the age of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up by 78 percent at <unk>
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer you're expecting is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel so happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people, ingenious and passionate people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what it happens, because what it is never in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about it every day.
And if you ever get asked, you get some thinner legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs, the brightest hair and <unk> <unk> but probably the most insecure women of the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of race and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image of the perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was moving enough to support a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no police directors, and no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even very much care in lighting.
In fact, most of them took them <unk>
My story begins in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
He happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to get the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown unknown one.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has no longer <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change life this journey.
It became sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in the way that a five year-old girl could understand it.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time on October and to reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in every way.
Because while we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter takes new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we expect with illusion every year.
And recently, on one of travel, we were walking, when all of a sudden, they stopped in a dry way and pointed out a red <unk> of the grocery store, which <unk> little over the previous <unk>
And he described me what I had felt at the age of five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> remembered their heart beating with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't get out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that takes the picture.
I want to encourage you all to show up in the picture, and you didn't go to somebody and asked, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, which was <unk> stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament have no clean <unk>  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> from the Old World -- where we have 16 species at 16, 11 versus high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> important, first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural garbage <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that was not driven and caused huge losses from livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where they don't have <unk> the cadavers they take three to four times as well in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
The <unk> also have a huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the license and the maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and beneath Egypt.
In mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural eliminating system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are the victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, of extinction, -- which means that in less than 10 or 15 years <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread on the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge amount of time bomb, to <unk> the number of product cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we need to work with governments, because wind turbines do this by birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a working problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to their government and tell them we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. They <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed of opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and all I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a nonprofit NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you have <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> <unk> to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends down into the <unk> River, and we teach local <unk> growing and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't know --  -- we were amazed that the local in so fertile valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking a question of how it was possible that we just did nothing, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> in time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a tomato block will grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe that, we were telling the <unk> "Look at how easy it is <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> showed up from the river and ate it all.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you love it? "You're never <unk>
I thought only we were Italians in Africa, but then I saw what Americans were doing -- what the English was, what they did was, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because you see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's see the <unk>  <unk> see the waste that I gave you to the <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western ideological countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
You just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
Now, Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just about two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any different culture like my kids, I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture of culture, like my <unk>
So the whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said because of the entire economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. who opened this lecture put a cane on the ground, and he said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided for 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They were <unk>
It never comes into a community with an idea, and you sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work on the offices.
We sat down in a cafe. We met at a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we really found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give it an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why did not do for once, but not in meetings within their communities.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with meetings within the community.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has been to <unk>
So planning has this other person.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go on their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor who gets together with you at your house, on your kitchen table, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a form of a <unk>
I started this as a test in <unk> Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. back at the time, trying to get away from this kind of crap junk where we get to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before we get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the spirit of business.
So now <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most educated people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to get to conversation with you.
You have to offer you for <unk> <unk> it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What talk about you have got more of this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution, not renewable fossils -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> government?
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story that I read in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year <unk> they brought together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist in 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve, and <unk> if the population is keeping up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> they were <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States -- in the United States -- <unk> generic companies, <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in places.
<unk> said, Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, you're not going to have to talk to you.
And then you have to offer an absolute <unk> dedicated service service.
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a fantastic financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can do, to sell and find the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked and looked at the <unk> of the <unk> world, <unk> <unk> Ford -- all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common -- only one: None of them started by one person.
Never word I, but the word 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business <unk> in <unk> along with their mathematically comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this <unk> someone who speaks to you, what should you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
They can help us in a lot of ways to make our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really swap a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> and templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much my neighbors are in their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which take a shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
It's always fighting the music.  There's a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture of the world, but also one of the most industrial properties of the U.S.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and a lot.
And it produced me a deep gratitude over time and lived in my life.
He gave the most significant things about my current life.
But I was trying to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be catching up the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends I transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant board and painted on her phrases for <unk> Before he died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the line of <unk> change.
"Before he died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before they died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before you die -- I want to match you once else."
Before he died, I want to go to the rescue rescue.
"Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about supporting the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people that wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit of <unk> in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to keep the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that are more empowerment.
And when you think about death that is inspired our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about individuals and as community and more media to share hope and fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Not speech, but it delivers joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It shares it <unk>
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and this is never <unk>
When I sing our childhood songs from our childhood, <unk> words that I couldn't even know me, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
Would you get the more <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remind me if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, would be asked, in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and <unk> birthday <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of the society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although I wouldn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> and <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development that faster in the world, there's no cause or cure for it.
I don't agree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self to be in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in his world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure on the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, watching the washing machine and eat anything that was <unk>
As I was growing more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who looked at the world without biases, a human being that had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments that I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> goes through the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and about you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in their inner and, frankly, the pursuit of self-interest is the ultimate sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher, which would give a type of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> real <unk> of these students with their great minds, and his big books and his great unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what it would be, it must have felt like when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had those conversations with the students that they were, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a huge communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are who are attacking our largest challenges -- from energy to environment and health care and health care -- and if we don't know that we understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as no scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations are not going to happen if our scientists and engineers are not inviting us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that you study <unk> but that I study the <unk> that are the network structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care of the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of its ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making stupid things.
Instead, as Einstein said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is using some examples, stories and analogies. They are ways of connecting and <unk> with their content.
And when you present your work, forget the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's going to be too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only of the single <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then providing graphs that will adapt to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you get.
I think these are just some key that you can help that others open the door and see the country of the wonders that it's science and engineering.
And so scientists, scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century, which defined him much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that seeks an public charge -- no matter what it was looking for or platform or first, and that, when wins, do it for the monumental use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
He was thrown in the London Tower and she was <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
There were all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it the State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the United States <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it a <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed act.
And there could be <unk>
All the world got tired of us, because this debate would be <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
The <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for if he gave him to him or his designated ideas.
So, they wanted to give her the most <unk> more insignificant and <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title. There was only before, but it only meant <unk> which was a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a question as ridiculous as <unk> and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things from all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as the title of President.
President Barack Obama is really lucky to continue there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stay waiting for the years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you, is that the title of President of the United States does not sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads in damage, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have measured the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was an uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to do with you.
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but actually change reality -- much more words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones -- with primitive.
Like each other, I carry a cheap light handed onto my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole that hold the walls of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost control and fell countless meters on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are at the deep end of that hole at the risk of their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home and went home, but they will never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native culture in over 70 continents in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the World Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not about a degree.
When we finished talking to me, I felt very sad, honestly I was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me choked up, the stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey into modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few people even, I thought I thought my second home.
But this time, we would take the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are currently over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much of the amount of Africans displaced throughout the slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of the <unk> of <unk>
And yet, today you can sell entire families for generations per year dollars for 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery is generating profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been fooled by false promise of good education and better work to find that they are compelled to work without pay, low threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who are producing them are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the brick of bricks.
This weird and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- entire families in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their head, and they take them from the furnaces to the time to 18 at the time and the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> and the <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no time to eat, not to drink, and <unk> severe to pee pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was too hot and it stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera is getting a lot better than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side to me, he grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I wasn't citizenship to that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for his release and he trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas he found children carrying rocks for miles per mile by <unk> and the trucks they were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children left and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of sticks, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this is all their life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely cut their homes.
When we hear the word slavery we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness they advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I was just driven by some steps that gave me to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known as the craft, they are <unk>
They have small, private, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven years -- are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where I <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, since we touch a hard issue, it's important to point out that slavery, even sexual <unk> are happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often engage with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of the black hands are the father, the blue <unk> and from red, from his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, however, being able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It is estimated that there are more than 4,000 children -- <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to take a look at fast.
I saw what seemed to be a fishermen family on a boat, two younger brothers, some younger kids, make sense right?
<unk> They were all <unk>
Children are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work a lot of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to it came up to me that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often catch networks and children -- <unk> and <unk> to be thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love I love is not going to flee and, like life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they were <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one in a day.
It was cold and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Kofi builds the possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
They took a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike. He suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and touched the window.
He asked us to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were trying to get out of the car, and he asked drivers to come out quickly.
And then signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that we would take on the road and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of pictures on my head as they were <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the road ended up <unk> in one of the time, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
Many women had their children strapped to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, they would go in waters of <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching her eyes tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people have got a heavy stone bags that then will be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer -- the margin we see at work with some less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be able to end up like this <unk> victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him on the mines.
When he died, his uncle, <unk> I inherit the debt of the uncle the force to be slave into mines.
When I met him, I had worked in mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident on the <unk> so serious that doctors said that he should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and, nonetheless, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of community determination, a remote possibility that inspires me very respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will bring witness to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazines -- they're people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I'm not thinking about these very beautiful beautiful people, I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that your force will turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematics applied and there's a particular problem for whom we <unk> ourselves as the management systems.
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So I'm going to try and tell you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We gave us the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> demands a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease <unk> gradually this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a really severe ballet dancer in his time.
Over the last few years has been done in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a Canadian weakness and stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to have tools to detect disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective and ultimately, the only way we will know if you really have a cure will be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's so frustrating that for Parkinson's disease and other disorders of movement are not <unk> and so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never have it.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test <unk>
It would not be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to describe it as not conventional <unk> to try it, you see, in some sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds when we speak, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal dancer because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed -- and the <unk> for example.
And as they knew it requires an extraordinary training level of training.
Think about the time that it leads to a child to learn to speak.
So from the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as we <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
shake a <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a <unk> cost it has mass cost.
These are some amazing lists for <unk>
We can reduce the patient problems of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could do it massive <unk> for clinical trials for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's Women's Initiative,
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no disease, it can call low price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've had six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease to be out or not, right?
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not hear it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in search of real markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> accuracy in this moment?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works on mobile phone network also, what we need the project -- now we have 99 percent of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March of 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We lie in the darkness, and no windows and large, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin still more perfect -- we make the impossible and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, I saw myself from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13, traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the earliest people affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We removed the mud and we leave the same lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
We loved it, and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers as neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and chambers and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places of villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that these pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center.
I helped clean the toilets, the huge, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were the honor and I had the honor that that day I would put in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond myself my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old, some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It was not too <unk> but where the water had taken away the face of the girl had to be <unk> with much precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came by luck and they got more <unk> and it took more <unk> so I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a neighbor town north of <unk>
Once the week we use our scanner in the libraries of the libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could have an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in seawater, covered with seaweed, with seaweed, even with oil, all of it along with the time I continue to <unk> so that <unk> was an important part of the project.
We couldn't see the picture unless it was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with the <unk>
We have a guide <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As I once said <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us all these pictures was kind of a relationship to the photos.
He had started <unk> she itself but stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A few colleagues of her husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble of the rubble that he used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the urge to close barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in water.
He took her a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her her photos her little son at the age of the age of celebrating 14.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could look at, something that I could remember in the past that had not been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us, <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean in more than <unk> photographs, the great <unk> -- the great majority came to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us to bring back to 90 families and totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 in teams and materials, most of the ink to <unk>
We take pictures.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, someone wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would let us look at, but the first thing that we want to look for.
This is what the project was to restore little bits of humanity, to give back to somebody who connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you get there.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger with something bigger with something bigger, using their talent for something that they're not working with perfect skin.
To finish me I'd like to read this email -- I sent it Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As a <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my newborn <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on a millionth of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create a slow motion of light in motion.
And so we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it into a second or a second or a second or a number of <unk> you create a <unk> pack of just a millimeter in a distance.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than that.
If we take that bullet and this pile of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread those photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --  -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes for the light to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
And the pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a pile of photons and starts to <unk> and that, in the inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the photons will finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside.
In that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the thoughts of the top is seen at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the thoughts are <unk>
Now, if we take a bullet and current and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? You know, a week? Actually, every year.
It would be a very boring film,  of a small bullet in motion.
And what about testing with nature <unk>
You can see the waves on the table, of the tomato table, and the wall wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of view.
But if you look once more and more of this tomato will realize that, as the light fall of <unk> is still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and light bounces out inside the inside and comes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to be <unk>
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
Like photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the bottom, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I'll barely get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded again and again with very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of that data in raw data and <unk> it <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of a future is allowed to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I'll go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It's very good resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
As a laser project you can record a picture of a raw, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to make collisions that are going around the curve, it's going around the curve,
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows by the open windows by looking at light.
Or we could build <unk> that could be able to see the inside of the body by <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about <unk> as a new set of visualization to solve the problems of health imaging in the next generation.
Just like <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, I became science in art, an <unk> art.
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can can be able to be able to make a scientific visualizations but we can see.
So create a new form of computer photograph with slow camera, and color code.
And look at those ripples remember, the time between each of those waves is just a little bit of <unk>
But here's something that happens to be fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these will leave us from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects. We have weird effects to see this image.
The order of the events that events happen in the world sometimes look at the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A cell can transform life, and you give you individual freedom to you.
With a cell phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and starting a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, transition to <unk> and become famous.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> in 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
So let's go back to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would come up with a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gathering that we would go through for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones, you go.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot of people today have a cell phone.
But today to talk about my mobile phone, and how it changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information is there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the National Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European <unk> every single Internet provider in all of Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who. Who sent an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored at least six months, and even two years, in your phone company or your Internet company.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet service providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of you even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany <unk>
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone <unk> that at that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, that please give me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to asked, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to build a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, "We won't give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
They build the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 <unk>
At the beginning I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge Okay.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the design retention means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open up City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zone, go back and forward.
You can see every step I want to do.
And you can see how I'm going on the train to <unk> and how often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talked a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they're called between them.
And then one called the other, and the other one on the other, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other to what time they call each other, what time to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talking to whom, who was sending an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said in the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall might never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> of <unk>
Because today, state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not out of fashion.
When you go home, they will take a representative of their representative because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you feed them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
That's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what's going on?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different direction, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, that's why we put all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> It can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were siblings, although they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you want to be a disabled person.
We go for a ride.
Christmas <unk> you're in the shopping mall, drive in circles in search for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 places in empty <unk>
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There's an <unk> of the <unk> I won the gold medal.
I'm a Muslim <unk> and I live and live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I could.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't think about <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> it.
If my three senior sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they became convinced that I was also outside, and if we didn't take every single note, all there was the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my feet on his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I get it.
The <unk> that I carry in was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a comic farmer who has received many taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arab and continue to be all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eat, so let's drop out of the dawn of sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy that I was sent to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't coming.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we won't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get them in <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and he would put me cups warm on the back, I walked down into the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But <unk> was the yoga.
I have to say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I could not stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents were looking at this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college by the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater.
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart tasks I took the maximum note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I was doing a scene of the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I've got <unk>
In order to end up <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> at the head of the theater, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, and I asked her why and she told me that because they thought he couldn't do the risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do the <unk>
It was a role that literally had been born and gave an actor, no cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors who have no disability for the disabled papers.
At school, I went back home, and my first tour tour, it was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> of <unk> are not <unk> actors -- not white, <unk>
Just get to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour of New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led when he fell at high speed on the New Jersey New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk> <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that women never heard that little <unk> that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother and another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the time you remind the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the computer news program, with Keith <unk>
I walked as if it was to graduate dance, I went to a studio and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the CEO and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling to the speaker desk to not go out on the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I stayed like <unk> full-time and pasted my chair.
Something was fun with Keith <unk> was that the people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that children are <unk> but never <unk> from me or a little girl or larger.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What does the disease have?
We really should be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't do the <unk> then <unk> you can't make somebody in <unk>
<unk> are the ... Yeah, <unk> man.
The disability is the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors say they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think it will be.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, you know, less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the entire society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I was <unk> by the red carpet that was <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> a charity organization to give children Palestinian refugees -- a fraction of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in live, and I do this talk to her memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives small people to poverty and on the brink of <unk>
Without anything there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there's no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year I was doing anything.
One day you get about a gentleman who offered him to <unk> him after dinner, after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives him a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home your family.
They present to a young man.
They finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life target.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That boy from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a little boy in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
He was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, expecting a future perspective, and this was the first thing that was arrived.
This was the first thing that took him out of what we call "the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> in <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity of the opportunity, of well-being, but young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who are suffering from high rates of <unk>
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities are under 18 years old.
If we don't include the young people in the growth of our cities, if they were not allowed to have the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> will be the history of developing cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital where I was born.
I remember being at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never gone?
And if I had forced me to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some youth leaders at a business summit
They went to about 90 young leaders <unk>
And we sat down and we had some ideas of ideas on solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate college college frustrated, I was the perfect white white white thing for Al <unk> and other <unk> organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach from point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle system can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It began by <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally could not afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> in <unk>
They encourage young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so hard.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was trying to train some of the young people on the summit of corporate entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years ago, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers.
For civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working on the creation of the world's first <unk> public park in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for a NGOs, working for government, but their story, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They were making business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a business of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation and work on their business <unk>
They provide young people with the resources that they need to be, they need the support that they need to move from conception to the creation, and will create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park, of <unk> is how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired children from the street to help rent and keep the <unk> for him.
He gave them the chance to escape from the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and it wasn't the way we <unk> almost to pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful Lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> apple balls of aluminum <unk> and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> they were too lazy to get out of what they thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed by me, and it was a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how <unk> or where you would have <unk> who clean up our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our garbage, about 11 tons of waste and <unk> tons of product -- every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked down the routes and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get a little more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I was not just traveling on the trucks.
And operated the <unk> mechanical and bar <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and amazing learning.
You all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong one would be quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies kept taking weight out of their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> garbage collection is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering traffic all the day and go humming around you.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck, and cause terrible damage damage.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It's always going to be movement.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important labor in the streets of town, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in and effective and effective every day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and its dangers inherent us in very real ways.
The disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries come to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old stuff, we don't have space for what the power engines begin to fail when is the consumption of the <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointing your relationship.
And then there is what I call our ultimate daily <unk> necessary.
That's just at the speed of the speed that we used to move in to move in early contemporary times.
We are usually not going to be <unk> we don't get to clean up or we have our coffee cup and our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a work force on the other side that is done.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the garbage collection that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to get <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a garbage truck on the street, he grabbed my little son and down the stairs running the stairs and there was a man doing her journey from paper paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank for her work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste garbage and went back to that man.
It's called <unk> and we work together so many times and made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have all the costs, even the real human cost of the labor of labor.
The municipal waste is what we think when we talk about garbage, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic of statistics.
So in the flow of your day and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, let's give it a moment to get them back.
I will give you a moment to tell you, thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally born of the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa,
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the cladding of it makes heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that's 20 to 25 degrees over 25 degrees over the entire year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa nor with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually enchanted with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to survey the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image is not there.
And it's also between two inner streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, uniting all the inputs from the building.
And this spreads with an electrochemical atrium, <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that was characterized by its own shape, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that was similar to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these tiny color crystals that use light from the inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it had not been easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center of it.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was to be much more profitable than the mall because in the end, there were more local accounts to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was extremely inexpensive -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it doesn't need to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is always short about every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling like a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, that they collect water from the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master <unk> plan and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a big project, the biggest one that I lived, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to his environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis I made special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a twelve gates of access to connected with almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation we did was broaden the streets, creating 12 early blocks similar to size and features that are in Barcelona and other cities from Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some dots in the relationship with the idea of the doors with the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the small cell in the project, as an apartment, as an <unk> part of the master part.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So we had a scheme to make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block, and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections for <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the ground plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the space occupied by the construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can climb and <unk> and doing activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes into local communities and local economies at the same rate growing buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions that improves the relationship between the community and the environment that they have to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had very bright hair lots of hair and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my teacher grades.
And then I did.
<unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit like this.
All the things like this.  And I set up to bring back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes -- too.
So in a <unk> they would take the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put in every rows of <unk> and myself a row -- just for being there, because <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was excited about the reason why I was bothered by this little girl, so small, so good to <unk>
I would celebrate jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the dangers of birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that we would run loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So we have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab where we study them in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know whether it's a exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, I would have no literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
We wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I had the reading <unk> reading lists of high school, because we'd be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year is a hundred years of their masterpiece, "In the time of the <unk> of the <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> my God, everything we could have -- and thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to <unk>
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot about how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, it comes from books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious as the jealousy, which is reduced to the person, their wish, to their <unk> are a very good <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel Arabs tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in the <unk> and audience, we know exactly what <unk> <unk> to <unk> the knife isn't it?
The <unk> do all novelists and <unk> and that's something that I <unk> I understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you the other, maybe right now."
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single cool reality that <unk> detects in his talk, he adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an <unk> emotion. You need to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> were <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> links well the language of the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his mother's agony and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search of knowledge, search of truth truth, a truth -- in fact, what it was to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> are the <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to suffer, that makes us suffer, it causes us to have a lot more profound and most profound feelings than a wise man who can be <unk>
We're saying we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was being used to be used with the idea that his wife <unk>
And Freud says that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get me in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it <unk>
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> are described very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, we are more likely to be residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal <unk>
The <unk> they drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at 8 years, I think -- but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman from 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which you would send awful <unk> to himself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to get her to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How big -- even though we can take creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
As a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to do how voices <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of the jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> it goes from <unk> or want what you have to do with your self and to <unk> what you ever saw, and it's under the floor -- <unk> your name, the <unk> <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you the whole world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but she's annoyed it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally at "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once they <unk> <unk> to everybody with your solution, <unk> it comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're the same side.
All of a sudden <unk> it allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to do the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So while we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Just fiction, <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> over 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work about 400,000 people and asked for 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, which truck after Armstrong Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> 10 pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 24 of the <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at Harvard University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why do you <unk>
Why turn it into our goal?
And you might ask, why will scale the mountain more <unk>
35 years ago, why would you fly about the <unk>
Why do Rice <unk> against <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West about this on the Cold War.
In the time, the strongest emotion was <unk> by the powers of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a sailing ship, but in 1969, the crew crew of Apollo 10 flew 40,000 miles / hour.
Since 1970, no human being has reverted to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimism joyful thing about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine technology could go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population, seem to be able to have a result of <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't take the <unk> tube tube from the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure that I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that actually happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists have found us and enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation that is <unk> in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created by less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years in which they are <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas that are driven by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their peak without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment, small investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technologies like energy, which needs a huge amount of capital and the development of the long-term capital is also not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound issues.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you go to <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from sources of renewables like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, businesspeople and economists are according to what policies and international treaties are making a significant increase in research and development and energy development and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there's no hope in the political climate of that we're going to see a political energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem technological, they turn out not to be.
We know for time that famines are a result of the failure of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes make a solution because we don't understand the problem really.
The Nixon president declared the war on cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant people to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to be found effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and should, but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to be able to solve the problem, the institutions need to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it meets those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction like ours to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
It was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very generalized belief box.
The second is an goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about it.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some activities, or institutions that might have gone up in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can put on the opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, they continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years are still pretty <unk> any nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the road.
But it's this evidence that's enough?
What studies are recorded are, of course, opinions.
What else can you care?
What you're looking at is <unk> attitudes that people are getting certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone will tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
I would probably be able to say, "What for?"
And that would be a very scary answer.
And you could say, when you've said your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other don't.
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or type of person, it's going to be a uniform in all the cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to give you the kind of reading, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend most <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop side all of that knowledge when we think of trust <unk>
I believe that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to <unk> the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not that goal that I <unk>
I encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are putting their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yeah, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters in the first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in commodities -- and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But yes, on the contrary, they're not responsible for us to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they will take their own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't heard about it.
But that's what we are <unk> on top before trust.
<unk> is the answer.
The top is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> going to go into <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we would argue that the accountability of accountability is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all have similar examples.
We took all that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of trust, and we will encourage people to be reliable and whether other people are reliable and whether other politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple actions -- the <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
You take the task to rebuild trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately, is signature because they give us some other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the bases enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you cannot <unk> by all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to have the evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, do the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks to me says that I can <unk> without giving explanations for.
You take them and take me back the money, or they change it by the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have trust what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not something very hard to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that frame, they can determine when the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> more and more and more, at such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when you get it strong against the screen transfers to the pixel body.
Designers can tell their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool, you break the barriers.
But both hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, with my mentor who were <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
And they put a transparent bombsight with these chambers deep to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, which is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and draw lines or words with the virtual tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we have to be involved in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and we make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will be bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make them physical and physical and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel of physical dream.
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally digitally digitally open the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and will be able to be able to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that sometimes we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physical movement, and, unlike your monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what's more fascinating to change the computer part of the computer is to figure out how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but that starting to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without us having to get rid of our world.
So we start the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you can take that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was thrilled to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1950s.
When I was in grade in grade -- the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all expenses payments.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After survival of the Islamic Revolution -- they believed strongly that there was only an inherent path towards the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
Whatever I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But any adult would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends love me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to get <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> I was <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books on here?
The ones that were eradicated in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about <unk> life.
And it's not real, <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange in it.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it is.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I find this with a new culture also led to my <unk> habit
So we put a lot of perspectives.
For example, in the beginning this map seemed to me, because this is what students in China learn.
I had never happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are the research fields as a comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was working for research, why not do it in life as well.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be people who are <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual people.
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> Interesting.
If you know other language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path from <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> on the road, Alan <unk> instead of lost in translation, I found that you can win a lot of her.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling or powerless ever.
Having a broken dream really is nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that self is not the only purpose of sleep.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
A broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client from <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman, called <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> encountered threw on the couch my office took off the shoes and he said he wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class of class had a <unk> like a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy just to move my head while they would get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Alex, and what I saw was right.
You start to work after that, you start to work later, it has children later, until death comes later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> brought me to push Alex to Alex who would talk about his life.
I get stuck.
I said, "Yeah, it's coming out of the guys underneath his category, <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not as if it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe you get <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call <unk>
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what they had, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of conceptual <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one gets to adulthood without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yes. It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take away the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's good. You know, <unk> really matter.
This is not just my view, these are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be going to be in the age of 35 years.
That means that eight out of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give them a way to their life will have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, you don't go to panic.
This audience will be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out of their future for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in its <unk> and it was <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility gets to their top for 28 and things become complicated to <unk>
<unk> are the time to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their daily life and common life has an impact on the person who are <unk>
But what we don't hear about often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> would give them <unk> names to <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and they say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't get absolutely nothing.
And then every day, highly interesting people like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship won't matter.
Or they say, "All say that as you start a race before the '30s, all will be good."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day I graduated from <unk>
And then he starts to sound something like this: "My dating during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the '30s, went switched on the music, and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one going to be standing, so I think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, choose a city, choose a couple, and have two or three children in a period of much more short time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there is a research that starts to show, which is a lot more difficult and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle class crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma got to my office because she was, in his own words, having a identity of identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in the entertainment, but you still can't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a very difficult one, their previous life had been even harder.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then she would wake up her own, "You don't choose her family, but he can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
He had just bought a new notebook for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning, and he had gone all the morning and I had a lot of contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that follows after the words in case of <unk> please call <unk>
He was about to <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident <unk>
Who will take care of it if it gives me <unk>
At that time, it was a lot of job to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really was <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit as the decade <unk> of Emma was going on.
So for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> or woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis, and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity capital, I mean making something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: capital capital generates capital capital.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you into the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited by the way that you know what you know how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes out of their nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak ties friends from their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have any work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the work created never <unk> so knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not released.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For last, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma soon took his family when he has a partner and it exists his own family.
I said to Emma who time to choose her family had come.
You might think the 30 is best age to sit at the head that 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choice to the person who you live now or now is now when everybody on Facebook starts walking towards <unk> not progress.
The best time to work on your marriage is before you do, and that involves being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be an conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found out to the <unk> of a cousin of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link was helped to get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with which she was alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, she loves her new family, and I sent a letter that said, "Now the space of contacts are not sufficiently <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, the 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea that was worth spreading to all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as I learned how to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: La <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your identity, get their <unk> and use their weak connections, choose your family.
They won't let it be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach me mathematics to seventh degree in public schools in New York.
And as any professor, I applied tests and tests.
I gave them assignments.
When I work it out, I went on grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance did not have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a top-down perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We tried to predict what we were trying to do in the military training.
We went to the National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to take away from the competition.
We studied professors who are working in neighborhoods really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and of <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private corporations, which of these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It was not the good look, physical health, and it wasn't I.Q.
It was purpose.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not the speed of speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater chance of <unk> even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like income income, the results of the clinical trials -- even the safety of the children when they were in school.
So it's not just at West Point or in the National National <unk> where purpose. It's also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little the science knows about it.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you do <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a robust work ethic.
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't make it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow their <unk>
In fact, in our data, root determination is not related or even related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at the University of Stanford by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our most strong intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start everything again with the lessons that are <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most favorite memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
From that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can bring down this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and faster.
A Chinese academic, <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy in it.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, long enough to read traffic signs of traffic, menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how this method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you might be able to be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like it was shouting <unk> <unk> I am <unk> -- this symbol is actually <unk> from the <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are a <unk>
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a cattle as <unk> in the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations of the ground.
They put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of remember, because a flying tree is quite an idiot.
Do you remember fire?
Two words together, it's very hot.
Three words together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Take a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> is someone at home?
This person is coming hidden in a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful about <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the Earth of the sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So one sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked one over the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the challenge has become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where it comes out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind remind you I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave her a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand of it.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial fantasy show.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise later with, again, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a <unk> kid and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk> of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of great differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz like the self-fulfilling -- <unk>
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the computer using evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most <unk> wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did about "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son.
Of just three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had <unk>  So he slid in the room and was struck as a foot of foot with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be themes of value, <unk> and <unk>
I mean, the feeling that Luke one of an army for overthrowing <unk>
I got this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How do Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with each and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow to grow up, right? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of capital attached to the movies for our children, and so little on the path of <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that the Princess <unk> does not give it the proper framework that would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think that at the time of the first kiss. I really expected the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My quest is done, I have a <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an animal <unk> and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are many exceptions, and to defend the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though them, the guys, are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and delightful as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times, still appearing on classic after classical, each of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the evaluation of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you have to do, in the film, there are more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more than the boy than you like --  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good film, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what a movie of Hollywood <unk>
<unk> isn't the proof of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the gas crisis.
We have a lot of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's take it in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 popular movies -- how many of them believe they have protagonists of them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's one larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what it said, "This is what it said.
In the United States, one in five women said that it's been sexually abused in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you do not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to beat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal of <unk> and we have to expect that to happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to the parents.
I think we have to show our children male children, a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what he <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What in common are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to engage their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and struggle and more stories where he saw his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I would join <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and the archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because in Egypt, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 3,000 miles of length of the <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern section of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in sight, it looks like to be brown, but when we use infrared and process using the fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find a <unk> ancient city called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Ottoman Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire, there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere in this huge set of <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
In the road, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find it at random that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientific scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of <unk> but instead of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for human occupation of change.
Five meters below, underneath a layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> of <unk> several hundred years that date from the Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones in the jewelry in the Middle Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> of occupation that date from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, it was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but I will go into the place in a nearby future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in using satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire, probably been written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
<unk> knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to it, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas happening actually started in 1984 B.C. degrees in a lost city not for a lot of time and found out of the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are competing on a <unk> race and go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of your house.
There are flying bike everywhere, wheels that pass on their side, the wheels that end up in <unk> places, the threshold of the gate, <unk>
In the lobby, or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light, the light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown bar.
It's a horse that he talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you can go into the mouth.
They go through one side and go into your living room.
In the room, and making use of their imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's wearing little clothes, dancing about your center <unk> singing <unk> One <unk> More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has covered with a yellow brick path from the oven come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies from different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people have to be of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
And I said, "Well, when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a teacher.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We'll have been trained to perform these miraculous things, using some old <unk> techniques invented by two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used to memorize the <unk> and that <unk> <unk> used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, "How did you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English <unk> although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to show you Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of playing cards in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending more of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what is your potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very much of the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> is awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He's based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And to come back, I read a lot of treaties on the writing memory it does something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined memory of <unk> was not a thing as rare as it might like this today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they also have a cognitive number.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you are still passionate people to be passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers in London College invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know, whether it has brains in a way, structural or different <unk> of the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more smart than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of the memory champions and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a MRI MRI MRI -- <unk> their brains as long as they took numbers, numbers, faces and forms of snow. They found that in the memory champions are <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed race in where every year, someone has somebody with a new way of remembering things more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there was 36 <unk> from playing <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And while there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques at the end of the end of it is reduced to one concept that psychologists call <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- <unk> says this: I say two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> there is a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, I wonder that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It has no relationship whatsoever to you.
With all the other memories you dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have <unk>
They do well when they go back home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when you take that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this date two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired them as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give you a very good party -- it wasn't brought to a <unk> you get to a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> her poem by memory, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
It will lead to everyone.
But not just killed them all, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where it had been sitting here.
I took the family of <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What we have to pick up at the moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good enough to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space memory.
If I were to tell you that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to say who sitting on the horse was sitting on the horse who was brown in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory is to create this building with your mind with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from 2,000 years ago to the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it by memory, the same way that he would have done it -- if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of <unk> crazy image and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And I'll remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote that you want to tell.
And then it would go in the kitchen, and the fourth issue that they would talk would be that weird journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how <unk> <unk> their narratives -- no word <unk> that will confuse it but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> the first <unk> it would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw this was simply fascinating, and I got stuck with this on it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something extensive about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring <unk>
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, that the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody else is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit seeing the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> bought in a market <unk>
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of your mind.
I was pretty hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a fellow of memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my whole research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Now, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone numbers -- and it's actually not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because it's based on quite basic principles on how the brain works.
And you don't need to get to build memory <unk> or memorize a little bit of <unk> to benefit from how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on it deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
So you get a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, it's what <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose from what's already our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side -- we are so <unk> that we don't even get to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capacities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we can just have a place -- New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm in <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at home my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there you all have the time watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at it. And every time I got <unk> and I was wrapped in a towel -- everyone was seen.
And I was like this.
He was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I was going to have that tour, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of areas -- but of those connections that are emotional connections, that we feel in places that <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to Environmental Protection Agency will be <unk> -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture will determine us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little bit naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about -- think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that they think about it by based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a very, very long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build museums of art.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Public Library.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's forms of life.
We made it and we made it so much, that we get away from the people.
And all of the black, this will tell us, you think that we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go on the other side and come back and connect to those symbols together.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experience <unk> We go swing the back back to go ahead and over and over again, so we've done it over the last 300 years, of course in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small scale on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started bringing those symbols.
Let's start the pendulum back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake to make new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turn them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The forms were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spend the time in commercial malls we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies they could be called the French or French or Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy. They are cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating from other stories.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the early 1980s, and in the early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now tell us with new <unk> design techniques in the computer, and we find new kinds of different ways that are attached to other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk> One is totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum coming back in the opposite direction.
But then, something happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when I critical academics and public in general, they were completely aware of a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao went up in a thousand and when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, and I Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible that they become kind of on the world around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms that they developed and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same one was done by the main mayors in the world.
So everybody thought that if they had these shapes, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium, country with other star architects.
She went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually began to happen with all of architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now -- that means that the communications speed has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not very accurate to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, eight, 100 more buildings, before you know if that he designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
<unk> was not a <unk> motion.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen.
My theory is that when we're applying it to the media, start to swing faster and faster, until they're in both extremes almost in <unk> and it was effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community -- and as the drawings looked like exactly the product -- there were no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that summer, when people started to come in, and they shared it in social media, the building stopped being a building, and it became a means of communication, because these are not just the images of a building, because these are not just the images of a building, which is the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes you engage with collective memory, and by charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture is because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that they have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library might be.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words that are <unk> and drawings and complicated, and you're no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that I haven't seen before.
The architects are listening to you, and you don't leave it from the architecture.
That means that the pendulum coming from one another, from one person to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in the ideas of what it has to be a <unk>
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we're finally going to be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will become <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means that three architects can dream swimming on the East <unk> of New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion -- so <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more intelligent, more <unk>
We've been waiting for everyone to want.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot in play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the way to the most environmental libraries -- the local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in this great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that she likes to do is look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
It <unk> and <unk> and <unk> itself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he asked me to think, When stopped doing this?
How is it that suddenly we're not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
I'm Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week at school.
He's got a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though his mom tells him all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells you it's ugly.
Out of what his mom says and what his friends or members of the school said, don't know who you believe.
So a video of her himself, puts it on YouTube, and asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, it has gotten over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal and running teenager that receives these answers into one of the most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving to do this?
Well, adolescents are almost never alone.
They're under pressure on online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young as young people.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your fourth <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures coming from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, constantly connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division of life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the most important thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the <unk>
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those that <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young young people.
But the kids are also also immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the <unk> of sports, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and are individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical lives, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six of the 10 girls prefer to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how they taxpayers society and the labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class arguments -- they are engaging in the classroom because they don't want to call care of their physical <unk>
One of five are not attending yourself at all the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you look at good enough, specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently thin, <unk> a smaller note to the average of your partners who don't care about the appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it becomes regardless of what these young girls are.
So, in order to be clear, we're talking about how you look at not how you're really like.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with self-esteem do fewer physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet not healthy that you can take to a food mess to a food mess on.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around the surrounding and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> <unk> <unk> sexual relationships, and no protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have any higher rates of <unk>
Eighty percent of women are not presented to an interview interview on a day where they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could get through this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes. The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the perfect images of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we follow our children will not only have a positive impact but also a durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone to provide an education in your body self-esteem that works.
An education is a fundamental education, but to address this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and we are a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the current status of the way women are seen and talked in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our <unk> politicians or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people so they are, not as you can see.
We all can start by taking responsibility by the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their effort and their actions and not look at it.
And let me ask you -- When was the last time you had a <unk>
In short, we need to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their individual valuing individuality, and diversity, the <unk>
We need to put the people who are actually making a difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to be able to see the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Your <unk> <unk>
It could just be just the woman in a distance. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice, in his interior, he would be able to have legs long, <unk> more <unk> a more <unk> feet plus <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this, and we would be able to save their potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are all <unk>
But let's give our children the truth.
And we would argue that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
It will lead to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year are becoming agents for insurance change agents of themselves tomorrow.
And let's do it.
On November 5 in 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed by the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Department of Defense <unk>
At <unk> initially they declared innocent but being imprisoned for other charges in the company of others, they started planning on attacks of 12 of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations <unk>
Luckily, those plans was taken by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't do it.
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a <unk> American mother, elementary school teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, including most Muslims -- come to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, they don't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all of human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that they think we need to use all the possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the weekends, he and some friends had been going to grade training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shooting <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my <unk> my father helped me hold on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise everybody, especially me, all the goal went on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a father, such child.
All of all, the comment produced them a lot of laughter. But I just understood what they were so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned to put it up with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt another 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which is uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to me 20 times -- that instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about someone already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always the face of the class often was a victim of <unk>
<unk> <unk> my identity to avoid being the white one, but it will be the new of the class, silent class, was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons why I did not have social skills, to say to say, <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera to judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put testing my way of thinking was for presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program in which I was involved in the UN Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was inspired by the theme of juvenile violence -- as I had been <unk> almost all my life, it was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had done.
I took a number of days to go out to light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that my whole life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer work in Bush called a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics I had ever seen in life.
Having been <unk> I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people kind, exactly how I would have to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that is being homosexual but I know what is being done by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All of night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment where I was desperately <unk>
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that he conserving in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else, who are trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I gave myself to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to talk about those <unk> acts like rejection to my father's actions.
With this simplicity simply, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to religion or race -- that children don't have to follow their parents.
I am not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment, there's a film that is projected in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has color, taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, and anger and happiness.
It's memories, like moments of your childhood that you project into your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your stream of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a movie internal movie you, you and you.
There is nothing that will be done more directly.
At least, I know that I have a own.
I don't have sure that you're conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we're getting to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science of nature, it's objective itself.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there's never a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, it would take that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, neuroscience was a <unk> brain -- but never no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, an <unk> of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations ...
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and with what certain areas of the brain do and what it is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to the <unk>
Actually, there's no problems easy with consciousness.
Well, not tackles the real central mystery of this <unk> Why every physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we cannot understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how <unk> work is <unk> and <unk> the living organisms all are questions about how they're working on.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we are talking about, how we speak, how we speak <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that wasn't working for reasons.
I think we're going to stand up at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- so we got used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you may need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that initially <unk> to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies all that needs to explanation.
Well, more power for him.
So that's the radical kind of idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
Now, physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the building <unk> space, time and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of the most basic issue.
Instead, you're considered principles, and there is building the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass law, <unk> laws and <unk> the basic market laws like a fundamental concept that these laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find in consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space space, time, mass, then for a matter of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental one, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to open scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space time, the mass, the mass, the mass processes.
Now, physicists sometimes say we want fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, <unk> in mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea isn't that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when I think <unk> always traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little mad for you.
How did somebody think that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural assuming that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that are thinking about the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there are information processing -- there is awareness.
<unk> <unk> complex, like in a human being, consciousness, complex.
<unk> of simple, awareness.
So something very exciting is that in the recent years a <unk> <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed it with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of data integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a <unk> of information integration is quite significant, as significant to quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, the particles of <unk> <unk>
The level of data integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness about zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness into the physical world.
physicists and philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the underlying reality.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can leave you as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything to have consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> you accept that vision, you're very hungry.
I think by thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas whatever matters in ethical terms, and moral terms, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the building of development of smart computers and the ethical <unk>
And finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group like the audience in a TED Talk, right now, we have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing that the second is <unk>
The vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we're finally going to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need this crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village at Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I was obsessed with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to get a community award for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a fair problem.
She actually didn't get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What's contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing to be extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we took the disability outside the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes at the class of <unk> studies -- a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people at wheelchair talk about <unk> things in the school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability with disability like inspiration objects.
And we don't are. And it's not the <unk> of the boy, which is true for many of us.
For us, disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire you."
And in fact, I'm on this stage that I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to do it? Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here to be <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lying in relation to disability.
Yeah, they have sold us the lie that disability is something that is <unk> to a spring <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable to you.
It's not something wrong and you can't make it remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, from the child without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a kid running through carbon fiber legs.
And there's a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn porn term that we brought to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, I will be able to have the disabled disability for people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life might be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you're that person?
I have lost account of the number of times that I've been approached by strangers to express that I think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images would undermine people with disability for people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something hard.
There are a few things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I gave myself to the so-called social model of the <unk> that tells us that we are more disability because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very pleased with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do it, by sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> other people with disability at all time.
However, not <unk> that I am nicer than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things they fall out --  -- the clever trick of how to load the cell phone battery into your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that you have sold us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lying is because it's not true that it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles at a stretch of stairs has never done to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen will not make the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> not to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to get up of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy at 11 grade at a high school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about it as it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at <unk> reality and soccer <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and on Tom <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would love with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the game of 160 blood -- blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a thousand pounds of <unk> we were trying to deal with all of his self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
I put some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, you give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology <unk> is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment -- let's get a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> mice. <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being on the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, it will be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people already know.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian roller coaster for his life.
What is a fan of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be a fan of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the background of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> <unk>
What is your experience when you get out of a mountain at more than 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of <unk> <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when the <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a quick review of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a <unk> plastic bombsight that you're wearing on. You won't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or you memorize the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is a way to gather information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option is to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high people on the bottom.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad people are <unk>
So this will take the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being just <unk>
It's also to be <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine you're the <unk>
It took the ball and <unk>
It took an open receiver of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your Norden bombsight -- that a defense behind you are going to move around, and it's not <unk> but the system of <unk> <unk>
They get the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there is an open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor can see in your bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
The <unk> capture the <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and the fans have followed the move from each angle.
This is something to create massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the ground.
They want to be their favorite player.
<unk> reality is to be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
Let's use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much does this technology is worth for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad are your actions from the prospect of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How much is that for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of Post-it notes.
Ladies and gentlemen, reality reality is close.
The questions we do is we do the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- as always, as usual.
Thank you.
I recently joined up after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I was <unk> the far south of the County <unk> which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure that was known above its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the building of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that travel between the two dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of the things that frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide <unk>
After one fall of four to five seconds, the body bumps against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bone, some of which will be vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
The people who don't normally get stuck in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that that <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, it is 32 inches from parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are for before they take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that boundary, and at the darker time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking to a official looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him July 22 last year when I was receiving a call <unk> subject sitting on the cord near the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an officer of the Golden Gate Bridge.
Jason had only 32 years and had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was flown down to two times before from New Jersey to try to hurt suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> he created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and it was.
This kind of kind of clever guy from New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been doing it.
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you do?
Let me tell you what to say?
In my experience, you don't just have to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
So one way to ask the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have been thinking about <unk> you've had these <unk>
They put the person in front of it and save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible, and they're never going to be going to <unk> -- to believe that there's nothing that you can do to make the social isolation, social isolation, and a lost interest of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience of being there.
I'm thinking that I should go foot to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the party of 49 with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with no bad mental illness.
It should not be that easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor -- not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the way her son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I replied to a radio call by an possible subject subject on the bridge of the bridge near the north.
I took my bike. I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the past time, I heard as Kevin talked about their depression and despair.
And Kevin decided to find that day back on that lane and give his life another chance.
When Kevin came out of it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did he did that <unk> and gave birth and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Can you <unk>
They stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> nothing erase the events on 11 o'clock in March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follow with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
He made Kevin when I was only six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
I hit debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes a <unk> When I visited the General <unk> at San Francisco that night, you would love the patient.
I mean, I know I had it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've been found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather is <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Typically, this is achieved by just three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls around the bridge.
In those incidents I've been directly involved in -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I was walking at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one <unk> the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us should be able to do with doing.
suicide is <unk>
There is help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner inside, you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you tell you about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone -- I'm not alone.
When I became a model that I was finally able to get the dream I'd had since I was a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with me.
For complicated reasons, that I'm going to be able to go back later, when I look at this picture, I think, you got it, you know, <unk> it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm getting started.
We all spread our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was exposed to the birth of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, I always wear this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom was, "Why don't you take that t-shirt at <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never told you to share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm a bad thing, but how the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I thank being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who will accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in Western culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk>
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
It was front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the head of a beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved on <unk>
He said to me that if he <unk> she was responsible for the mandatory fees and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and he got a third <unk> between over 40 terrorists.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from queen of <unk> women -- but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they were <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom. She had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that it was my application for the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you cling to the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was in Thailand for 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most highly sophisticated surgery and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to have surgery before we changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity identity means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it was a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he was able to end his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of November 20, we make a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Right now, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my alone and just me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that some day no longer has no longer <unk> 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. <unk> first, thank you all my <unk>
I have to be in my own network of support, to my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when I was called me and they told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other not. It's just gender identity, that's what's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we were all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that task didn't block, and there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies, to parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National Prize for <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, and for exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome or his father, nor his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of <unk> a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When you give birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a child, when you tell her third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only do the female mother, but the daughter. The newly <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers from too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, sit at home and school admits of her brothers.
Until the age of 12 years, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
He can play with your friends on the street, and you can move on the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it meets 13 years old, he was appointed from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that part, honor, could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of course, code of honor, not only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and his friends of his sisters on behalf of honor.
And there's a more norm of societies that are called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the best one.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and his mother and the decisions of the elderly even if they don't will.
If you do it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man, he has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter, and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
They were born, brothers and sisters, when they were born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, one to be honest, but when I was there and looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with an <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half years old, the <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a big event for life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and his name.
One applied to school means that it has gone into the world of dreams and the aspirations where their potential can explore their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and you'd be spent two weeks before, when we were <unk> the form of a tourist <unk> <unk> and I was in the relative of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters writing in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and boys as well.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
He taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights to human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's involvement in all the political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls are banned girls to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you speak for their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and got up to the right to education.
He wrote a post for the blog of the BBC, was offered herself to the documentaries of New York Times, and he talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and on October <unk> 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would love to my wife -- "I've got me <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't you <unk>
It takes the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play for the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get stuck.
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words would come to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe severe pains, because his facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was taken through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm well with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to get good enough. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we got stuck.
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like every <unk> girl.
<unk> when it's not just his task.
They fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What about my mentoring in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave, expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You're still like smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It was not the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if it didn't take nothing, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I have had to decide about combinations of <unk> and <unk> and try to stay with life.
I have more than ever saved me.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to be able to get the dose of trying to get the doses -- because there really doesn't exist a clear map that will tell you in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the dose of the dose dramatically -- my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking about my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried doses and typical chemicals for a man in the twentieth man, and I was surprised to see how I was looking at my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some versions of it <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in the front, and it just doesn't.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to be <unk> -- since then I got better with men.
What I tried to do about how to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my full piece of ideas.
We think almost always in images, and that became my key point of how to do these mental imagery that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought the images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how your mind works, to me is simple: for most of us, the mental imagery are fundamental to <unk> thinking, <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I get to find the point right now, and I have lots of great <unk> mental <unk> and really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use his imagination just to steer the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could take the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two recent groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology -- MRI fMRI -- to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle of the middle shows the scan of the brain of that same individual while you're looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the contents of the upper column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same picture is almost a <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves in the visual fields that are <unk>
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a great pool of reactions in the brain in the video sequences in the sequences of video.
Then they showed them a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were so <unk> a new <unk>
The computer -- using just the brain brain information -- you know, to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're well close to it.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This is done with the <unk> of brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution has been a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many are proposing new projection techniques to projection by images, even me. <unk> with the recent story of the MRI -- first we have to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> just offer small improvements in resolution -- not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than big magnets, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
Why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make really big magnets, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the supervision and radio <unk> in sound systems.
At turn, instead of a magnetic field they can run down magnetic patterns structured and <unk> to radio radius.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of functional radio processing -- we can increase the mass form of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid, but the hormones of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We're going to be able to put our ideas directly into digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this tool could lead to <unk> disease and similar diseases.
We have few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, they choose one year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet probably to tell some person for the first time that you love to say to somebody who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation that you have a way in life.
Everything I think is a hard conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> experience experience and have come out of that closet a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through various stages of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And to be aware of the slope of my <unk> and I have my short <unk> and I would ask me my head a little bit, I would ask myself a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would show a uncomfortable silence on the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, it would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and mother <unk> a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible sense.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
So, that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to get in full of the female issues, on the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," they <unk>
And so I took a deep <unk> and I went down the look and my back a little girl from four years with a pink <unk> looking at what was not a challenge for a feminist, <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're <unk>
So I took a deep back again -- again, I got <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is confusing.
I have the short hair like the one guy, and I saw clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
All right, I'm more of the kind of girl than a <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me -- he was paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the most easy conversation than I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some ways in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a closet.
It's like my closet. It's not different from yours or yours or yours.
I was going to give you 100 reasons why it came out of my closet it was harder to go out of it, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who has signed up in <unk> is harder than to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I say is harder to tell your five-year-old son who are going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it's hard to do with respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse in relationship to our lives, and we should only feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security <unk> or less security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made of, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, and a dress and shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child four years that would fit into the coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my head gay, and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever ever done.
My family, my friends, my whole little strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world would turn around for purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my <unk> pair launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that a lot of guests knew that I was gay, and as I was doing my <unk> lady in my black dress and I walked around the tables and finally came to a where the friends of my parents, people who knew me I was <unk>
And after talking to one point, one of the women cried to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who would be <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, you know, but instead of desperately showing her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses a <unk> shirt, <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like the hard conversations remain without being my strong thing.
Ask anybody that I have ever <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents who might be gay, they will remain the hope that it could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never be influenced by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> by what they've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark closet I think, a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy it.
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence of a productive example -- it's been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of it is as interesting as the question of if a sub can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical <unk> criticism as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I set up a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race that you don't know about any of the biology of the Earth or the Earth of Earth or intelligence from Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're in a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any idea about the Earth of the Earth, you would have to be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even a certain moment in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- the asteroids that are <unk> from doing it.
And that's why I claim this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have been trying to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action with the end freedom of making complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and put together together, I said, "Well, since many years ago, there's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can pull out of all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of one and = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a train force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force with you, with the diversity of potential futures accessible, yes, to an imminent time in the future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open choices.
And so, having in account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> <unk>
It takes the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to be more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> between entropy and intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system in which you can find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, play games, play games, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without it to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for robotic robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, I just like some other animals can cooperate pulling away from the opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly getting together and maintain the network right now.
This very <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand worldwide from the way to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in the problems of defense and, logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and running a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of actions, successfully increase the assets under their management exponentially.
This ability for risk management will have broad applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would have been <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades -- we've had the whole concept of rebellion in the other way.
It's not that the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's the way that the impulse to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of goal.
They often ask me, how do you seek goals come from these kinds of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go through the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence to help to understand human intelligence, is the following: intelligence has to be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, over the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission. of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what it points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets of our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the dim <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, they block a little bit of that light that we get to get to us.
The data gathered by Kepler they show the sizes of planets besides the distance between them and their parent star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get in their suns.
At turn, this gives you clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The <unk> was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since the millennia, they're now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused global scale has rapidly <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist from the weather, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested in finding life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better than our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world to show this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study so much on Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> follow their surface in pursuit of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the ability to live on Mars.
But even though all of these images, we will remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still left for <unk> places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and <unk> and older and the Earth and air is fresh and filled with oxygen filled with thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable the Earth.
So I like the exploration of exploration -- I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to be there to be <unk> to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic going to be more late in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration and <unk> and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> zones of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment called the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, having in mind that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets will protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us ourselves, but the <unk> exploration and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to identify the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I would take my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window they were at the dining table of the dining table, where they had been <unk>
So quickly I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all were off.
I thought I'd call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend the night because I had a early flight to Europe at the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that it's not more expensive than a <unk> at the night, so I thought, even though I was in spite of the circumstances, I was going to go.
I'm a neurologist neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- and the adrenaline levels and <unk>
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking myself, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in place that was going to make bad things happen.
Or at least if bad things happen, you will give you the chance that it is a total failure.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts would be <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> and a little embarrassed I told him about the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny <unk> with me who had been practicing something called <unk> retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might get wrong, then it's trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, you get a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes are <unk> where they live tribes and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables you to find its nuts.
And if somebody really did the experiment, they <unk> the <unk> sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move a lot, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car keys, you read it and <unk>
So in the house, a place for your keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a particular drawer in particular.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card, a picture of your credit card license drive, passport, please be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain frees up.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation that when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them make a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all decision-making decisions and in fact for social decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we have to take from the fact that you would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have already heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- you probably have to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for most physicians don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needed to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you should think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's someone's fault -- it's about scientists like me.
We have not really understood the mechanisms that are <unk>
But <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it is?
How many people have to take it before they help a person?
300.
This according to the research researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a single heart attack, or brain <unk>
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 than I would get my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic -- and it's <unk> of the <unk> right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> pain pain and <unk> pain -- but they think, "The five percent are not very likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out <unk> by the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, part of the first of informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air on the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the older men of 50, <unk> from the prostate to cancer, the number of people needed to treat it is <unk>
So I'm 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just per year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we would bring the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, you want a smaller life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain at the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is shut down a whole bunch of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't really react quickly. You could get the lunch lunch so that nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes down the window during those moments of stress is the obvious logical thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the snow evening in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination next to the door, with a key to the door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite name.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the score, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing from a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time, it mixed with local signs, and it was developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country -- following their rules, <unk> behaviors and standards without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
I have learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the <unk> bag <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, sure not <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I call it a <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is about coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> for decide.
<unk> for going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to do it with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I only have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has gone into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience that visually, or even a idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the number of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a little bit of a listener.
And sound is so powerful that it might be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or my artistic job, or I could be able to get it.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support myself and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and the institutions, work with lots of different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me become <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to <unk> his voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value, something like taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could do it in <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new art medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two is very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning in the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> is split into many different <unk>
If you map a different <unk> for every finger while you play the piano, as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you can just one point at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a concept of clear or idea in <unk>
If only one key thing would change the chord -- it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I see <unk> through the glasses of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put up.
This is all day."
If you do it and <unk> the speed, visually speed, looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what is expressed in <unk> and how far the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present becomes closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Watch <unk> hand <unk> <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through your head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a shape of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them with high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in my head as your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I would like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest -- they do it very different meanings here.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step for a <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you need to hear about music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove -- and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to get you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents were telling me, "Can you get to <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination was led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults will lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they are not really good at cleaning the others.
The time, now I'm an adult and teach citizen and invention in the <unk> School of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of garbage piles of garbage.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats
So along with my students, with ages six to 15, we dream about invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
And we collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to push it into something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the children would get a lot of the robots.
Then we quickly created what we call "A <unk>
We are so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we put light bulb and web cameras on accessories. And we would see it in a floating robot that will slowly move through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this led to step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they're trying to fix it immediately.
I investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they get stuck with this image:
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where it comes to the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil are also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> that allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in remote form to other kids.
I investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started a number of giant waves of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear center to the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the Pacific plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of traces of <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it does have safe it is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and researching independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we talked about the data <unk> that day and talked about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigments to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this, we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate of it.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition the closest to the date.
We can zoom in to a half miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and build it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with very simple open-source technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of fibers, you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in mobility in the old age transforming their chairs in new standard wheelchair on new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, creators <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other one thought it would have.
One is designed by nature, the other for her.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> and saw a figure that fights about being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures aren't <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells -- we have all the information required it for every cell to work and to make it out.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made of parts, including the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects, as different parts of parts of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back is more thick with little <unk>
One acts mostly as filter as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that moves gradually its functionality through variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my view of the world -- double the personality of every designer and architect to work currently between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and analytics and synthesis, it is shown in the two screens behind me.
My job at the most simple level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, pulling out of the assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask you, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment, where four disciplines that offer designers that offer access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through this scale of scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> scope of diameter with a force that some day not very distant to print buildings -- <unk> and graphs made from genetically engineered buildings that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> an archetype from the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is size to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion display of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I will show you more objects like that.
This helmet is combined and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this highly resolution of high resolution, and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair -- a very comfortable chair -- and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor came back to nature for <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
It was <unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but continuously the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and it has got leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land was growing trees with branches, <unk> <unk>
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be if objects were made of a single piece?
Do you get a better state of <unk>
So we are looking for the material to take up the kind of material of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons produced every year because of organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune your properties, we could generate structures that are going into a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> marine concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures on the scale of a number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these <unk> structures made from one material, long, 100 percent recyclable stuff.
When the pieces are ready, it stops dry to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, the bacteria designed genetically designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out without problems of beam beam and if it broadens even more to windows.
A dense <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects that we designed for <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, they will help grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control its flow.
So like the <unk> board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as a liquid biology -- only from <unk> metals -- <unk> metals and new biological ones in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We have our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk>
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One makes light in sugar, the other consuming sugar and produce useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship to a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the digestive tract that will help us to <unk> these bacteria and to make their function away.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they were more transparent <unk>
This system <unk> <unk> when it reaches from one end to another, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels of life inside your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures. Only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that are going to take our skin, we save the human tissue and destroy our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
And so we always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer prints in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates an highly sophisticated architecture in which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers to each other.
And this is happening throughout scales.
The silk worm first turn on the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then it begins to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk.
And yet, by putting the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, and we realized that <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different places, and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is being transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk will become <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we saw that <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process into the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk and, we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that worms of silk went into the darker areas and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, distributes the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a line of silk online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to deal with us.
We put them very carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while they <unk> <unk> they were <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about <unk> silk -- they give all this pavilion to its integrity.
And in a little bit over two or three weeks, they <unk> silk worms -- <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the road route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time this?
Can you get your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and I went on the website, I was playing the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I would take care of something else, something totally different, and I will get myself in it, and I let you absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again that point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this stuff into a career.
I thought I had to choose a thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that made it so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about engagement, or to be dispersed, or to <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to get back then.
They teach themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you believe it, they learned about culture.
So you ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were saying to that age.
It's considered a <unk> question to provoke nice responses in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is done again and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students, are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise before you take away the dream.
Why?
While this issue is inspired by children to dream about what they might be, is not inspired by dreaming of everything that might be.
In fact, it does right on the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though successful adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what's cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> Amy editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative principal.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is really <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and to dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a breath of <unk>
It could help if you divide into three parts: <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms that you can put the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
You know, any term you like or your own one's your own.
It seems to me as a kind of a adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or <unk> you have to win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in being this way.
Here's three superpowers who are <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, he found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
In <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> a mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation occurs at intersections.
There comes new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower -- it's learning fast.
When we were <unk> we go into something, we go to it.
We look at everything that we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we are less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we have -- so we rarely start to zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a child pianist -- an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before I become writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting their practices and this ability helps to write a responsibility for the editors.
I rarely have a waste of time to have a waste of time to do what you're going to do -- even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower -- it's adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other <unk> designer <unk> sometimes consultant to Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can help them to meet the market needs, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep in depth and put together in ideas, and <unk> offers a collection of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But all of us should design lives and careers that we can do with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will be told by just more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you would go through all the media.
That's where you give the best thing to do.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes, and I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
Let the intersections.
It takes our inner wiring into a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world will be <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but I would take care of it until unfortunately, in <unk>
After his death, he was doing a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you were to have been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has come a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for the cancer for HIV, <unk> for HIV, and so much more.
But little has been done on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million people, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the probability that you spend their years -- with Alzheimer's disease or helping take care of a friend or want to be paid with Alzheimer's.
Only in America, Alzheimer's costs costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs costs, a <unk> increase in 2050, as the generation of <unk> booms as the generation of <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical challenges and our generation.
But it has been relatively <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the research of itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a number similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared to the one of a Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory loss and mental skills, damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these colored dots end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots come up, they stay outside the outside.
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
So you have to find the right step that we put it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been reduced and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new type of drugs that they blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs were in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have a protein molecules that stick into each other, like in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive <unk> but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have <unk> that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and if we can see it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move through HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I would take this article in the column of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The paper is a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when we test it at the same end of the last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers are <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would be?
Number one: When was it the last time you ever heard someone else person?
And <unk>
<unk> these are more and more personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do or her -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to somebody you have ever known.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a little detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column of a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask some of you -- they are probably going together.
And the reason I think they challenge this is because you've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was actually so nervous.
I'd been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog can come to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and I thought that my New York Times would have probably some thousand views.
And that took a very good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and since Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday, I had been called USA  Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence in writing with <unk> of own <unk> experiences but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an individual has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or write what they did every day for weeks -- always, they did the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk> still <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students of students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article <unk> for San <unk> who posed the experiences of readers by proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us were doing a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> the orders of <unk>
I think I was afraid of becoming the icons <unk> of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really wanted to know if they were able to produce <unk> love -- not just an adventure, but love, love love.
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, mostly that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we put together or not, and then they <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this case in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking forward to <unk> <unk> among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds simple, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were closer to doing that, several subsequent studies, they also used protocol <unk> <unk> <unk> as a fast way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used by members of the police and the community. And they've used them among people of <unk> political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work on.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you're going to tell you about the person who you do it.
Well he made a break.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
I said, But became better friends?
They found that they were able to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it's about love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and it was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to almost almost my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I turned to science.
And I did everything that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just went to research for the book that I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I went to myself with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat back then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than most people can be demanding me.
What I'm looking for is a love -- it's not just being <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know whether we were all together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate something of the risk of <unk> and this is a very scary story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the history of history still together?
And their content with an answer or <unk>
So more than a question, let's ask ourselves more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and get <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in doubt with <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation, about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are still getting together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered all that choice.
It didn't look at how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times will I have to continue to make that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as generous, kind and fun and having expressed that choice in the largest day of the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't think really.
And what we <unk> and what you might spend my life looking for is that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually write it.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's scary, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised in full <unk> and in a way, I became a <unk> of the forest.
New York City makes a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species would be, ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was at <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make a invention and all of those things, and I was making a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> like Agnes Martin, I covered it in resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and she is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: the opposite happened. In some way it seemed to grow size as if they were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things my life, trying to figure out, and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing like you do around a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens from <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started writing exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend on dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets similar to the drawing on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together, which is a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a great measure in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of their time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
It's five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are moving between two worlds.
They are coming from the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a god of bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in one hand while the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a narrative.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and spits up <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail.
Anyway, the tail turn on fire fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go and you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball <unk> <unk>
They've got them <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they're cards of terrorists.
It brings me to my last project.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years ago to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a picture of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazine.
But each other acts of a kind of file in a human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they're <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's <unk>
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 billion pounds with a dead human inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the entrance is <unk>
I'm going to see them for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, one kind of thing is <unk>
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there's a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a writer, a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a school, an editorial arm, which spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
It took the box and all the people inside it hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has a effect against pain, first happens by your stomach, your guts and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug to get any effect on your body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs -- these are <unk> to decrease the amount of viruses in blood blood, and will increase the heart of cells.
But they are also known by their side effects that are <unk> in its very negative people, because in the time that it takes to get to the current blood -- you get worse and worse in the time that it takes to get to your fate, which is where it is more important in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph node <unk> the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily in the blood stream of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by getting oral own.
One day, I sat down and I thought to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for wounds and diabetes for diabetes, you can be used for anything else that are <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open up or drill out of extremely small holes that open and shut down, almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a very powerful laser beam on the living cell membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
Today we're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> technology, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll make a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is running to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, which releases directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to maintain open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to HIV HIV can lead to HIV.
Yeah. One cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups not by armed groups like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these generators factors and study ways of encouraging violent participation of violent participation to <unk> <unk>
I do research work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> deals deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we must understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do, how do they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and the policies didn't get <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global picture.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military system.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> met by their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the Gaza <unk> since 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire here.
Maybe they're multitasking things.
So we put a complex machinery of communication stations and radio stations on television channels, websites web web web and strategies in social networks.
And here is the <unk> and <unk> magazine in English and published for <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising fund -- but by using business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to invest in better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
Political groups also try to conquer the population of offering something that the state of no security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to see the efforts of these groups for offering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a <unk> high for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum <unk> a <unk> gap by the government, and they allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill them gaps by the government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participating in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated people are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They run part of a territory, run all of its <unk> collected the garbage, they run the system of <unk>
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nation and hybrids and the weak the states, like in the Middle East -- the most step in the Middle East and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
We were able to get that governance vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups better than we will understand better and better understand what incentives to encourage the transition from violence to violence in violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors, and the military power can win some fights, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To get these goals we need the long-term investment to fill that security safe, to fill that safety of the government that allowed these groups to thrive in a very beginning.
Thank you.
I'm an failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I would tell me as a bad feminist feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The Good <unk> and after interviews, people started to call the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had weird ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated and women all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a word <unk>
I would remind me as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I was in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
To me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it <unk> free <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use <unk> and accessible the contraceptives and services <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, not need for <unk> <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have on account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> -- social condition and skills and so much more.
We have to have to figure out these differences and how we behave the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> ours is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I listen to rap music volume.
Although the lyrics degrades to women and offends the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin <unk> <unk> is incredible.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely upset by my music results.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks but also killing insects, the collection of junk -- the <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and really nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of <unk> fairy tales that become reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> it historically the needs of women of color, and gay and gay women, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, it's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist <unk>
It also happens to this, as a neuroscientist, I feel a lot of pressure.
So we have this tendency to start <unk> it into a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we take the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative innovators and leaders are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing standing up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear of what that tag means for fear is not being able to fulfill with a little bit of realistic.
Take <unk> or like I call it, I call it the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> word <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star taking openly feminism and to know women and young men who be a feminist is something to be proud to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started <unk> whether they were <unk> it was not a feminist.
It would take his feminism, rather than just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go beyond the sane and <unk> criticism to <unk> feminism of any woman, <unk> until nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Bad feminism is a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We need to recognize our <unk> to the day, will happen to the action and be a little more brave.
If I listen to music, I'm going to create a demand for artists that would be more than happy to deliver a <unk> supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively to their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick something better, and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions do that make it more difficult for women to make gender equality, gender equality we all deserve and our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and <unk> and also very <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were told by the strong creatures they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go into cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they will encourage you to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also engage them to be even more like us to be able to overcome barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our gains.
We can make these small acts of bravery and expect our decisions to go to the top, to the people in the power of directors and movie producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make big decisions, more courageous, to create a meaningful and significant.
We can also tell the bravery of our feminism, -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, above all, because I think, my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident in front of what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know how kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that could matter.
But he was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what we can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also found that if it was a little brave another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the anything that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I hold the real reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need to be <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a child immune system, is one of the more easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak -- they hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines were <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines are putting their children in danger of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very weird disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creating their own professional life without seeing one case.
Over decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> <unk> about funds like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could get another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people in the Center for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like diagnostic diagnosis, and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't make a lot of <unk> the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his two-year-old son contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so reduced in the beginning?
Why were it so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is that what happened less to do with slow progress in the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a psychiatrist and Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> he published an article that describes 11 young patients that seemed to be <unk> <unk> worlds to people around us, even their own parents.
You could fun for hours by shaking their hands to their faces, but they were gripped by <unk> as when he didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as a major authority of the world in the subject, declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we <unk> references to places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> to give that diagnosis for children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
It caused autism as a <unk> child caused by cold and cold parents.
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully on a refrigerator that doesn't get <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish 18 <unk> before I turned two years old.
When her mother put one of his favorite records, he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents -- desperate to win their approval in <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, turning invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a bright autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like black-eyed Susie, no special education, no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Foreign Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of prevalence of autism in the general population.
I had a <unk> of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
And what they saw left clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more diverse and diverse and diverse.
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise, these children didn't fit in beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model would have predicted before.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one ever notice these children before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article that was <unk> and then he was buried buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article from the competition, but I avoided <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in the clinic started with music, and the kids follow their games for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described it as disabled as a disabled disability that required <unk> and <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called them their little teachers, and he had been devoted to help in methods of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of instances and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they always had been, seeing aspects of this continuum in architectural culture in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and the teacher <unk>
He was beyond even saying that for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong in which autism was <unk> as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked silently with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s, the early '90s, their changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes didn't go into broken down.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked in order to reform these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and parents all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced the first simple clinics to use to diagnose autism.
I should not have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes on the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they expected the way that they were, so that people with autism and their families finally bring support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccine for the increase in <unk> and a very powerful, <unk> and <unk> history as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of the prevention of prevention than one of every 68 children in the United States are right in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are because of the new developments in medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from attention deficit <unk>
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for more <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities for support, communities with faith in their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
